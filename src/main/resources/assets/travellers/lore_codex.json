They used to trade with the Bandini, but since the situation began in Darat, very few Bandini now have cause to come into Sabor, leaving the Pilipai to trade among themselves, and enjoying a lot less variety of produce.

Aswand haughtily announces that the Bandini under general Alkabar invaded Sabor for its fertility. I do not contend that this was something of a draw, but it was not the primary reason for the invasion of 559. The main motive was, of course, that Sabor was not a unified territory, but a collection of city-states. As such, by raiding just one or two cities, he and his men could easily take the spoils and return to Bandinia. \n\nWhat they did not count on was the unification of Sabor by Epilomelos. Epilomelos played on existing harmony between the states of Sabor, and was able to lead a combined force to drive the Bandini back. Of course we know what followed - a staggering reprisal from Epilomelos' men. They took no prisoners, and the Yellow Blood River ran red. By 636, almost no Bandini menfolk remained, and millennia of servitude were etched into the wall."},{"guid":"dc921a89bf9608f5b08ebc96a8369eb1","knowledge":50,"language":"Verduban","parentName":"Foundation in the Dark Years","pieceIndex":2,"text":"Many question the value of ancient history, but I draw your attention to current events. Look at the labour camps, are they not the legacy of Alkabar's arrogance? The lack of Saborian guilt carries over from that assault in antiquity, when the peace of central Amum was disrupted. This is not of course to excuse the actions of the present leaders of Sabor, or to gloss over the obvious hypocrisy at the heart of their system. Nor am I suggesting that the modern Bandini, characteristically apologetic, are in any way at fault for the actions of their predecessors. \n\nIn 559, the disparate cities of Sabor were taken by surprise, as the Bandini, led by Alkabar, crossed what is now known as the Yellow Blood river, through the Amum mountains via skeleton pass, and ravaged the Saborian desertlands. They burned villages, looted farms, and used captives as shields. Worst of all they set fire to, and gutted the city of Cherno, over which the modern settlement of Conos now sits. The terrifying assault was unprecedented and unexpected. Rumour has it that Epilomelos, a very small man, wobbled atop three wooden crates as he addressed an anxious crowd gathered at Momoros.

The speech received an ovation, and the die was cast. \n\nEpilomelos was elected general of the armies of Sabor. He began by pincering the Bandini by unloading troops on the northern shore near the border, so as to get in behind the raiders. Soon after a massacre occurred. The Bandini surrendered, but it made no difference, as the Saborians killed all their prisoners. \n\nSabor's transformation from disparate cities to one nation was only just beginning. Epilomelos, by this time, was already determinedly idealistic.

Bandinia was derelict and barren even before the war. Sabor was already too large a land to govern, and they would have been happy enough to see the Bandini more or less castrated. \n\nSome say the Saborians left because they were ashamed of what they had done, but there is no proof of that anywhere.

Bandinia itself is accessible via Sabor, although it is a one-way ticket. Once you cross over, you won't be able to renew your documents, and will have to make your way back home from Darat or Driss, where passenger flights are few and far between. Your best bet is to make your visit in the Month of Nuess, when there are many more frillships heading out of Bandinia on their way towards Koinos. \n\nUnlike Sabor, Bandinia has a system of currency much like our own. Bandinian coinage is distinctive in that each unit varies in size and quality. Unfortunately this leads to plenty of debate as to whether the coins in your hand are counterfeit. Most Bandinians will value the metal itself, even if they won't believe it a genuine coin. Add to this the fact that any given purchase can be haggled, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nAs a general rule, take 90% away from a price and work up from there. 50% of the asking price is as high as you should go when making a final offer. If you can get a few good deals like this, Bandinia is one of the most exciting places to shop in Foundation. Every part of Darat seems to harbour a secret trade. Metalworkers, Carpenters, Glassmakers, artisans of every type. You get the impression nothing has changed in thousands of years.

The rates are unreasonable, but worse, it is believed a lot of the money is diverted directly into the coffers of the corrupt royal family.\n\nAll-in-all Bandinia can be expensive, or very cheap, it's up to you to get the best value you can. At first the landscape may seem barren and unkind, one of craggy sheep hills and dusty mountain passes. But if you head to Driss in the south, a dune-like landscape unfurls, and where the ocean laps the shore, sumac and ocotillo grow. \n\nNavigating will require either a private skyship (which you can hire cheaply), or a guide and some mules (even cheaper). There are some interesting table-rock formations in the north west which jut upward above the dried-up river valleys.

Do not be fooled, the dancers may be looked at, but it is deeply ungodly to even approach one of them. There are dance halls everywhere, and you will be encouraged to participate in some of the other dance styles such as Mestallus, a sedate and sensitive dance that requires a rhythm in three-time.\n\nMost of the other entertainment on offer in southern Sabor relates to trekking and exploring the desert wilderness. There are specialist citizens designated for this exact purpose, so expect to wave goodbye to your city guide. In reality, exploring is not as free as it sounds.

There are special perils in the Mount of Plenty region, including the Siren plant that reacts to contact with the skin by giving off a chemical alerting all of its species to your presence. The Sirens will all then simultaneously expand to five times their size, attempting to corral you. An experienced guide will often keep a long knife for just such situations.\n\nDitching - As was noted in the section on Northern Sabor, entering the country is expensive, restrictive and brief. Some travellers choose to circumvent this by \"ditching\". I.e. landing skyships unauthorised in empty parts of Sabor in the name of adventure. Apart from the fact that you are committing a crime (punishable by death in the worst cases) you will find it extremely hard, even in the laid-back south, to avoid questions about your identity. The little book of entitlements not being in your possession will put even a Pilipus on alert, and with the rewards, make them likely to report you to the authorities. \n\nBandinians - You will notice there are quite a few Bandinians in this region, although not in Conos itself. They are immediately recognisable by their shabby dress, and the men by their long moustaches. They are the only non-Saborian nationality with free passage, and are left unsupervised and unrestricted in their travel around Sabor. There are several reasons for this, according to Thaumenon, one of my guides in Bandinia. One he says, was that Bandini used to get past the border control or ditch so often, that it was tiresome for the Saborians to regulate. Two, the Bandini are so afraid of the Saborians, that they generally don't stay for long. Three, they provide a valuable exchange of goods with the Pilipai when travelling around. Bandinians travelling in Sabor are often dangerous to non-Saborians, as they will think you an easy target for crime."}]},{"name":"Hette Boege Guide to the Kioki Unity - Central Karem","totalPieces":4,"pieces":[{"guid":"d7aca81272b72c80f7c0c10ead891bd6","knowledge":15,"language":"Verduban","parentName":"Hette Boege Guide to the Kioki Unity - Central Karem","pieceIndex":0,"text":"<An introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>\nCentral Karem\n\nOnce you're out of the bustle of Karem city, and follow the river Kar up to its source in central Karem, you may find it easier to navigate on horseback.

Chiefly it's a love of the wilderness. Their ardent survivalism we may easily misinterpret as heartlessness, but these are real people used to a few hard knocks. \n\nThe cities of Putty, Qahvzin and Albodan are all in this region, producing massive amounts of wood.

It is believed that some time in the first millennium, the course of the river Ish that ran from the fertile plains to the south coast became diverted, and that Ishgiruans were forced to become nomads. This early setback now seems part of their national psyche - an acceptance of the need to keep moving on. You will find Ishgiruans are typically impatient and have no time for fools, they like to do business fast and quick, and know how to make best use of their time.\n\nMost of the ancient Ishgiruans went west, gathering at the spit of land now known better as the port city of Ten-Rui.

In particular they will mistrust and question the attitude and actions of whichever Warlock currently holds office.

But as a notable footnote, those responsible the palace coup were themselves tried and found guilty of murder. The sentence was reduced on account of their having strong motives for forcibly removing Orthosa from power. \nThe sombre mood of the trials, which lasted for more than three years - the same length of time as the occupation itself - eventually made way for a bright and joyous feeling, a honey-sweet time of celebration.

I'm not sure if they were short of horses, but I'm of the opinion that the donkey was a better casting decision. Frankly the whole point is that the Queen's chosen lover is more modest and humble than the other suitors, so where a horse might seem a little aloof, a donkey is perfect.\n\nThe depravity of the Mellifluans knows no bounds, but suffice to say this donkey \"Mo\" put a lot of relish into the wedding scenes, and it paid off handsomely.

I was pleased to find it cleaner there, and less refuse-strewn, than the floor of my apartment. I was tipsy too, that helped. I'd sold a painting, and I'd spent the proceeds as if it were my last night on Foundation. The money was completely gone on wine, and as the sun began to rise, my venter felt ready to vent. As I lay on my side, desperately hoping to recover, I looked across the platform and into the dawn cloud. It was there that I saw it; a new colour. \n\nI may be naughty, but I never lie.

An old song came on, and it made me think of my lost loves. Not loaves, loves. All thirty-six of 'em. I had some fruit wine. Then I took the bread out of the oven, but it was too soon, and the inside was raw. I threw it in the bin, and the whole process somehow reminded me of breen.

I can't even remember where I get my paints from. \nThen one day there was a big party. I didn't have a paper invite as such, but I heard the noise.

How different, yet similar, is the city of Ten-Rui to this thriving darkness. Both are chaos, but that is the rich soup from which variety is born. \n\nAnd some of the first people are still here!

We were walking beside a lagoon, when before I knew it, a great snakehead was hanging off my arm, fangs deep. I could feel a stretcher beneath me, it was made of the skin of the snake. A terrible pain set in, my vision melted, and I could see the Pekoe busying about. They applied a salve to the arm wound, and pressed bitter, numbing leaves into my mouth.\n\nWhen I awoke, a beautiful girl stood before me. She seemed unable to smile - you know, there is no business here more serious than life itself.\n\"You were one of the lucky ones,\" she said. \nThese Pekoe make Ten-Rui touts seem positively jolly! The girl was typical of her people. Every scratch and itch causes them distress, yet they permit spiny plants and savage beasts to freely proliferate at the ends of their beds.

It involves the careful preparation of fish belly (usually the Common Lipknaw), rolled in a peppery breadcrumb crust. The saline reduction serves only to extend the saltiness to an unprecedented level, but can be countered with the addition of Miri-biri seakelp, which burst with a sweet acidic freshness on the palate.\n\n\"Berserk pig, dressed in Tree-nut sauce.\" \nThe berserk pig is an ingredient that must be handled carefully. A common mistake is to pacify the pig, and kill it quietly. The best chefs know that, unlike with most butchery, the meat of this pig is best when the animal dies in a berserk state. The animal will only become stressed if it does not reach a berserk state before death. \nA common method is the blood feast, used by the Chabuti (it is a little gory, and the Mellifluans have banned it) whereby the pig is starved, then released into an arena with mice, that it chases and devours. At the peak of its lust for mouse-blood, the pig is stuck through the skull with a spear point, its face a picture of ecstasy.\nPreparation aside, the dish is simple, hearty fare. A Tree-nut sauce usually accompanies the roasted meat, and is made of crushed Tree-nuts, shells and silks removed, a whippy wine-cream, and fresh herbs.\n\n\"Wild horse olio, with snudge, bellet and mossycress.\"\nA peasant dish from the hills north of Melliflua, now eaten the world over.

Kibbles add some fibre and balance. A sweet almost medicinal sauce of yakka leaf is ladled over.

Should the male be unhappy, it is common for the woman to remain unmarried for the rest of her life. Author's note: The prenuptial dish is traditionally served to both the bride and groom's family. As such, fights often break out when some underlying reason for the couple not to wed prevails over the quality of the cookery. In one case, for example, the father of the groom declared the bride-to-be's dish unpalatable, allegedly because she had rejected his own advances.

Young salt crooks are collected from the tundra, and carefully rinsed and pickled in brine so that they remain fresh and green. Boiled Ogballs bring weight and further soft comfort to the dish. As long as your ingredients are fresh, you will have no complaints from your diners, especially if the weather is bitter, and the night is long and dark.\n\n\"Crab Pie.\"\nThis pie simply must be made with blubber pastry. No part of the whale goes unused by the Tarrery, and blubber is held in the greatest regard. Melting blubber down to an oil is common practice.

The exception to this is the long neck, of which no part of a mature animal is wasted.\n\nThe friend of visitors to Karem looking to sample the best food, would have to be the Warlock of the Fields or of the Harvest, who you will find at the chalk circles outside Putty.

Marrow of the flying tree monkey. Bitter herb syrup.\" \nThis relatively balanced dish still gives the guts a vigorous workout, and sticky dried fruit or some such for pudding might be wise.

With skyships, it became possible for Huacanado to receive some fish, though due to the long distance from coast to capital, the dried stuff still remains central to the Pinnish diet. \n\n\"Pinnish Goatbear festival pudding.\"\nThis is a curious thing, in the main because the Goatbear of Pin is an elusive creature, while its festival pudding could be said to be the least elusive of all puddings.

Hawk, owl, heron, duck, chicken, goose, sparrow, turkey, swan, and lastly the centrepiece, the fried breast of a miniature eagle. Birds are iconic to the Ishgiruans, yet this dish shows the contradiction at the heart of Ishgiruan life. The best thing about it was an intense truffle cream dashed between the game.

A healthy dish that feeds the poorest Ishgiruans, but one I would be happy to serve in my restaurant. \n\n\"East coast salad.\"\nThe east coast is a place of music and home to people who just want to enjoy life.

What better way to enjoy the bitter cold shore of Gautine, than to spice your dishes with the wealth of unusual ingredients that grow in the south Verduban hinterlands. A small apron of temperate soil drapes beneath the volcanoes and the southern highlands, where it is shielded from the icy wind, and it is here that unusual culinary species are cultivated. They range from piquant anise to bright floral rose peppercorn, and permeate almost every dish of the Verduban repertoire.\n\nAsh berry soup with chicken and beer.\nThis is a very distinctive and warming soup. The base is made with finely diced onion and beer. Once this has simmered suitably, a very thick chicken jelly stock is added, and once separated, a handful of whole ash berries are added. Once the dish has bubbled away slightly, the whole thing is sieved finely, and is served with crusty malted bread. \n\nNuggin-cheese tart, with lardons and winter greens.\nNuggin is a flowering plant, whose seeds need a very hot summer to grow. Fortunately, the glasshouses of the aforementioned apron of temperate land in south Verduba provides just this. When added to dishes, these little seeds lend an earthy nutty flavour to mild tastes such as cheeses. Though they love stews and soups, the Verdubans also like bitter green vegetables that grow so hardily in the grip of winter.\n\nSeared Peppered Ox, with babyhead beans and charcoal.\nThis Ox steak is cooked the traditional way - over an open fire. It always comes with babyhead beans, shaped exactly as they sound, and a dabbing line of breadcrumbs and charcoal.

Then there was the cold, and the constant darkness.\nAll things considered, I didn't want to spend the remainder of my life underground, and without Una to comfort me, regretted the moment I first stepped into the cave.\n\nNot wishing to dwell on the gloominess of it all, I took a handful of worms, and navigated my way back to the battlefield where I'd seen the moonlight streaming in.

After some fruitless wanderings in the caves beyond, I trudged, exhausted, back to the burrow. \n\nThe burrow was deserted. I pottered on through ante-chambers, low-ceilinged vaults filled with glow jars and earthen pots, seeing no-one. Finally, at the far side, I came upon a room with a furnace, and a chimney leading up to the surface. At least if I were stuck here, I'd have somewhere to keep warm, I thought. The furnace was part of a machine that manufactured all of the little jars to hold the worms. One of the tabards was next to it, sifting sand between her paws into a silver funnel.

On this evidence alone, it is possible to call the criminal a libellist. This person wanted to bring the family name into disrepute. It is my belief the culprit wanted the owner of the book to lose his citizenship, suffer the shame of exile, and see his family dispersed.

Ants the size of foxes who live only in darkness, a horse that peeled to life from the trunk of an ancient tree. But foremost, was the story of Minuras of Conos. No sooner had the wise-speaker begun it, than the Saborians became quiet and attentive. \nLong ago there was a terror known as the Windebeast, a spirit born entirely of cloud. The Windebeast terrorised the delta, and many innocents died in its stormy grasp. Minuras of Conos bravely decided he must slay it. He undertook the journey north to the Mount of Plenty, where it had its lair. He had heard that lightning would erupt from the Windebeast's fingers, and decided he must either be so fast as to dodge them, or else so well-protected as to endure them. Not being known for his speed, Minuras fashioned a gigantic shield twice his height and width, behind which he could conceal himself. On entering the cave, the Windebeast poured all its might into the storm, and even Minuras' clever shield was not enough to deflect the jolt. They say Minuras was found three days later, burned as if he had been on fire, but still alive. Minuras was pronounced a god himself, for in the effort to kill him, the Windebeast had fractured into a thousand eddies.

Four in the oil bar. When they tried to escape they got trapped in the soil tank. I couldn't resist going in to gloat. When Iooked at Shank's face poking out from the thick wall of soil I saw something that surprised met. I was expecting the fear, but I wasn't expecting the respect.

Won't that have the same effect?\" I replied.\n\nHe spluttered, clearly struggling with what to say to save his skin.\n\n\"Erm... Well, if you leave me and my boys alive we'll have your back.

It was a warmer reception than we expected after the circumstances that led to us joining. The boys gave us a surprising level of respect.\n\nBeing a Marauder was a sweet gig, even if we were just a pack of Scabs. You wear those Marauder colours and people know you mean business. You don't actually need to do that much fighting if people expect you to be a monster. We'd usually just roll up on some trader ship, they'd throw up their hands and offer us whatever they were carrying. Easy.\n\nThey helped me look after Barrin too. They gave him any bits of old tech they found on our travels and provided him with loads of Thuntomite carcasses. He'd gotten really obsessed with trying to make something using them. They start to smell after a bit, but I could tell he was onto something big when I saw a carcass covered in wires and metal bits floating in his room one night. Well, sort of floating.

Rarely did any shanking as far as I could tell. He'd been asking around about the gang that killed our father, he'd narrowed it down to two possible guys. Either it was another Scab called Oik or this nightmare of a guy called Cinderhead. Oik's gang consisted of about 6 people with a reputation for itchy trigger fingers. Cinderhead's gang go by the name The Strong Boys, which sounds ridiculous, but they are some of the most dangerous guys in the skies.\n\nI asked Shank if he reckoned our crew could take down Cinderhead and he snorted his drink out of his nose.\n\nI took that as a no."},{"guid":"29c7d97b59636069e84c6afa964f41b4","knowledge":25,"language":"Marauder","parentName":"Stasis","pieceIndex":7,"text":"Over time my feelings on this crew softened. There's something that we'd been missing since our father died that we somehow found with this group of physically impressive imbeciles.

If someone disrespects you, you break a finger, not a neck. If someone tries to cut you, however, all bets are off. People soon learn to give you what you want if they know you're going to leave afterwards.\n\nI pushed our crew to take on bigger and better targets.

Basically it's a backpack that... Sort of... It sort of \"pauses\" motion? I guess? Something about atlas polarity? Whatever it is, it looks scary as all hell. I don't know if he did it in purpose to make the things more intimidating but they kind of look like a skull... or a demon. It's made of a bunch of different things, but there's definitely some pieces of Thuntomite in it. I guess that explained all the shells he'd been messing with.\n\nWe took the prototype to Shank to see what he thought of it and you should have seen the look in his eyes.\n\n\"This... This is amazing! This is exactly the kind of thing we need to give us an edge! Come look at this boys.\"\n\nThe other guys in the gang crowded round to look at the pack.\n\n\"I call it the Stasis Immobilizer\" Barrin said.\n\n\"That sounds ridiculous. Let's call it something cool. How about the Immobilator?\" suggested Shank.\n\nIt was the stupidest name I'd ever heard but the others all grunted in agreement.

Our opponents had no idea how to deal with us.\n\nThe downside of having a new toy that no one else has is it puts a target on your back. We had other crews coming after us every other day. The upside was that we didn't have to do any more work on figuring out who killed Barrin and I's father. When Oik came for the Immobilators I knew immediately.

Moments later we were catapulting across Oik's ship. Using the Immobilators meant that Oik and his men couldn't get a lock on us. We'd killed half of them before they'd even drawn their weapons. They started shooting but that isn't enough when you don't know where your target is going to be.\n\nOne or two of Oik's crew tried to board our ship to distract us, but they quickly fell into Barrin's traps. I trusted the men to take care of the rest of them, but Oik was mine. I knocked him down with a knee to the head and kicked his gun away. He looked up at me with contempt, but also acceptance.

Initially they were worried that we were setting traps for people and using the Immobilators as bait, but once the first through transactions went through without a hitch word got around and it was easy to offload packs (although we made sure to keep enough for ourselves too).\n\nSoon most of the smaller Scab gangs had an Immobilator between them. Those guys hadn't had the time to figure out how to make use of the packs, so by the time the bigger gangs came for them they were easy targets. Easier targets than us by far.

From there we were each able to live in relative peace and safety.\n\nI often look back at the terrible things I did to get us to where we are now, but I have to believe that they were worth it.
