codex.b24214e0b5e4b8e67e5a66ba5fbb089f=Hello, Enna again. Feeling sick now, but it's the skyship, it gives me nausea. I can't imagine what Coriola would have thought on that maiden flight! The height always puts me off the Apotheon you know. Not very godly am I? \n\nI know you're down there on leave, somewhere green. If I get time off, can I come to your farm? I want to lie on real grass. Our foundations, firm ground, it's so much more exciting don't you think? It's no floating bubble like Momoros - it's real. It's as if the only real people live down there, even if life isn't perfect. That's why I like you, you feel real.
codex.d7208aae429a1c4af5f5081cf6464683=The Elaine took down another today. It was a victory, I think.. The Elaine is a better ship than ours. I want you to know though, if you felt even the tiniest bit of remorse those Mellifluans died, so did I. Theirs was a woeful broken thing. \n\nI had a beer with our captain afterwards, and she and I ended up talking. I kept thinking of you. She and I are good enough friends, and I wanted to tell her about us so much. But I promise I didn't say anything. She says, \"we women ought to stick together\". It reminded me of what you said, that you always feel happier with us in charge.
codex.994adef3a717a13518e60b43dfc65dac=I'm thinking of you, thanks for your note, though it was a bit scruffy. I hope one day you'll read this, then you'll know I do acknowledge you when you pass me by. I'm just trying to look normal, because they can't find out. I mean it would be a shock to them all to know about us - you a deck-hand, me an officer.\r\n\r\nI am god, you are mortal. Once I join the Aetherium, I cannot be with you. I can love you here and now, in this life, or not at all.
codex.3e6a676ce26da3325f842dc6352d0e33=Hello. It's been so long, I know, just hold on until next month. I haven't even seen you above deck since those heavy cannons hit, so you must be working hard. I'd like to visit if I could. It'll be so refreshing to see the boviaries, and meet your family. I never knew we got fuel from beasts. Enna. X.
codex.0415d4c5af6d92a780bcdf65f233619f=Did some more drawings of you. I am so tired of waiting. X.
codex.c5f610a3a2e2cbb037df0855931c3c90=Thank you, I feel awakened. You said your home was beautiful, and it was, in a way. I felt anxious the whole time, so thank you for understanding. \r\n\r\nWhen the earth moves is it normal? I didn't want to offend by asking in front of your brother. You looked worried, and I wish we could have talked for longer. \r\n\r\nIt's strange, but I feel so much safer up here. I hope you don't hate me for saying that. \r\n\r\nLove, Enna.
codex.3ff326c422c350f96c4b6005f0fe52e9=I've got you a game of Becat with the captain, so you better accept if asked! \n\nI said you could easily be reassigned, that it was your time, and that while you may be a Pilipus, you longed to be a citizen and you felt you had god in you. I honestly believe you could be god, but there is more to come if you want to get there. \n\nYou must be more supportive of others, take on a few good causes in Momoros. If you can do that, then I really believe you can be something. We're going to need more than just pilots if we want to keep this silver whale running.
codex.7f3bbcc25a5e2790da47d9d3545fafcc=I know, I know. I've cried so much. \r\n\r\nPlease say your arm is getting better? There was such a loud explosion, a lot of the crew have lost their hearing.\r\n\r\nI wish you could write back. We are god. Love Enna.
codex.0086825c523453d8950a329fa014a924=I knew the godhands would let you back in if you brought fuel. If you don't have that or Atlas now, they're not interested. I've heard stories about Telemon, closest to god of all of us, but I refuse to believe that he can barely walk. \r\n\r\nSome say he hides himself away not because he is busy, but because he eats seven times a day. It cannot be, since even the citizens are not eating well at all. \r\n\r\nI hear there is such a shortage of tokens, and people cannot afford to eat, or when they may, the stores are empty. What has become of your kin? The farms? I'm sure when the war ends all will be well. I miss you. Enna.
codex.0410936fbf20d6440a702b66883658af=We have been given new \"toys\". Have you heard? I can't believe how long they take to get going. For every enemy life that's lost to one of these, I feel like we should sacrifice one of our own. It defies, you know, some principle. I mean, are we still gods, if we must use the hulks to do our dirty work? \r\n\r\nIf our enemy has the courage to face the ogres, surely we too should have the courage to fight with our bare hands, like in the olden days. Give me a sword, and let us duel for the stones!
codex.a4298e9b29059ce270656ee4aeb8162c=It seems like the war will go on for years. I have no choice, I have chosen my side. We are gods. Let us win for Sabor, for better or worse. Let us trust our leader and hope the committee has made the right choices. We are gods. \r\n\r\nI miss you. I won't write here until I see you again, it's too hard.
codex.b238ab2f96c32f3ceed526b71d47f1ac=Grandpapa blowed a hole in the flame. He said I must try to sleep. But I was scared and I couldn't, not with the great purple howl, and the shuffling of the beetles, and the endless night, and the din of the children swimming above and around us. \n\n\"Our new home will prevail. We have all we need. Just have to hold out young 'un, and wait for the storm to end.\"\n\n\"Tell me a story,\" I said. \n\n\"It's time for sleep,\" he said. I folded my arms crossly, and he knew I'd not let up until he gave me a story. \n\n\"Oh alright.\" \n\n\"The one about the armies!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes.\"\n\nThen he put his arm around me, and knelt beside my splintery bed.
codex.967b22f64379978d48eee81eb7144bde=\"The year was 2743. It was a promising age, when the stone first came to us. This concerns your great great great great great great great great Uncle Sloop. By all accounts he had a thin and measly head of hair, which he liked to conceal beneath a leafy hat. He lived in the autumn hills of Karem, just up from the first bend of the river, where the water breaks white and violent at the weir. Where the river Karem rakes across the valley, and thins up towards the Pintins in the north.\" \r\n\r\n\"But Grandpapa they aren't there any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! They are, in my mind's eye. Anyway, your Uncle Sloop had no job, but roamed the foothills, living off the land. But the winters were hard, so he'd come down off the slopes into Karem to seek work. One year, there were murmurings of war, both sides wanting the Atlas in the Kioki mountains. Lucky for Uncle, the army was conscripting, so he joined up. He was a fine shot, and he knew the slopes as good as any. He was at one with nature, see, but the other men couldn't stand him. Sloop always worked best alone.\" \r\n\r\n\"Once the barber had taken his unruly beard down to a fine bristle, they set him off with a scout's provisions, up into the forest, where he would be most at home. \r\nHe hiked upstream, where the river narrows enough to cross.\r\n\r\n\"It was there he spied the Pinnish camps, their ponchos and fur hats dotting the far shore. It was by his rapid return and advice, that the entire Karem brigade appeared opposite two days later. They made themselves known on the lower bank, patrolling proudly under the Karem flag. At their hip were pistols, and at their feet cannons dragged by mules.\"
codex.835bf3c168b3cf87559b4080c4ef4cb0=\"The Pin trained their weapons upon the adversary across the narrow gulch. The order from their side was to wait. Hands twitched on triggers. Cannons were jiggled and primed..  \r\n\r\nIt was your Uncle Sloop that caused it. He had a strange sense of humour, and at the moment when all were most expectant as to what the other might do, he stood upon a rock, put his hands to his mouth and made the sound of a gun with his cheeks.\r\n\r\nA wide-eyed Pinnish soldier responded wildly. He lit his cannon fuse, and its aim being unrehearsed, blasted the ball across the gully and into a tall tree. The tree teetered before falling a distance from the men beneath.\" \r\n\r\n\"What happened next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, since all but the silly soldier knew it was Sloop upon the rock who made the noise, a bout of laughter began to echo around the gully, and soon both sides were hysterical. Since none were hurt, no harm was done. Both sides conversed by means of bellowing across the roar of the weir, and agreed they should make peace that day, and resume fighting on the morrow.\r\nBut there was to be no fighting, since the Empress of Ishgiru, having heard of the dispute, resolved to form the Unity by which the three states of Karem, Ishgiru and Pin would then be known.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, my Uncle Sloop brought the peace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes he did, in his own sort of way.\"
codex.cf67e6a6a9b568f4bbb72d73715a34d9=Whether you have a mummy or a daddy, were born to the south or to the north, this book is for you. A strange and comforting place lies in the soft heart of your pillow. So lay your weary head down, close your eyes, and listen to my words.\r\n\r\nImagine yourself floating, up and up like a skyship, until you are face-to-face with the big moon. Then big moon kisses you on the cheek (kiss your child now).\r\n\r\nThen imagine a green garden with boughs of fruit red and gold. Then a kind Pilipus, who weaves peacefully there upon a chair. Then know that many gifts are yours to have and command, since you are chosen, little one. You are god. You are god.\r\n\r\nThen you float up once more, float up again like the greatest skyship, until you are face-to-face with the big moon. Then big moon kisses you upon the cheek (kiss your child again).
codex.ad900bd7847e30232ce56e1092688a23=Then imagine the Night Lands. A kingdom of eternal night, of mud forts and spires. Foul-smelling sewers, dark alleyways, and a mist that lingers. And from the mist a clicking noise grows louder and louder. The sound of many legs rushing towards you, the pincers of the ant-men gnashing. (Child may be afraid, but this is normal) \r\nBut you are not afraid, since the ant-men will soon be yours to command. You are god. You are god.\r\n\r\nThen you float up once more, float up again like the greatest skyship, until you are face-to-face with the big moon. Then big moon kisses you on the cheek (kiss your child again).\r\n\r\nThen imagine a stark place, of old blood and death. And from the grey soil beneath the ashen peaks, Alkabar rises, with his phantasmal legion behind him. His skull is broken and distorted from the armoured heel that stove in his face. Yet it is you who stands guard before him, knowing that you are god, and they merely mortal. Unwavering, you feel a surge of power fulminate within you, and then ecstasy, as a great bloom of sunlight tears out. It slices through Alkabar's blackened bones. \r\nThe moment he crumbles to dust, his army crumbles to dust.\r\n\r\nThen you float up for the final time, a hero of Sabor. The bosom of Aetherium welcomes you, and you join the collected. You can see all across your kingdom, from Redusa to the Studded Desert and beyond. You see all your people, the corn harvest and all your animals. You hear every conversation, see every thought. You are god, you will all decide what's right. You are god, We are god.

The Warlock of Metal jangles in from behind it. He is robed, and wears the ceremonial helm of the Mercantile Authority - a downy 'coonskin topped with an oversized replica of a coin.\r\n\r\n\"The charges brought against you are very serious,\" says Metal, stepping into the chalk circle, specially constructed for the assizes. He removes a copper coin from his moneybag, dips it into candle wax, then rolls it along a wooden floorboard. The jury and the gallery watch its journey, gasping as it loses speed, begins to wibble-wobble, and finally ripples flat. Metal steps out of the circle, and walks the length of the room. He peers over the object like a heron, and happy with the outcome, returns the coin to his pocket.

codex.a2c2738c53271a0212a5b03bb1ef3949=The History of Sabor until the 4th Millennium. By Meulen Beek, of Redusa.\n\nChapter 5. How We Became Gods.\n\nBy the 16th Century Sabor had largely overcome internal divisions and was beginning its path to enlightenment. This was a society that cared for everyone, ensuring that as a people they fulfilled a potential that was obvious from the very beginning. What once was a lowly collection of disparate cities that had allowed themselves to be bullied by Bandinia was entering a new era, in which they would come to define the perfect society. One only has to consider the sun-drenched earth in which the early Saborians found themselves to realise their existence was no coincidence. Sabor was born divine.\n\nBut understanding came gradual. It was some time in the 1500s that the Saborians finally began to bloom. Shrines grew in number along the river Redu and ritual flourished. Many now viewed life only as a beginning. Life was a test of resolve and prowess ahead of the Aetherium. A commentator of the time is Lady Pyrrhanes;\n\nLady Pyrrhanes' Scroll, c. 1547\n\"And the stones were washed, time and again. Death forsook those at the rising place, for death no longer held sway. Each man and woman were bequeathed from the first god, whose lineage is pure. Thusly, all can grow to be god by communing with the stones to reach Aetherium.\"
codex.5f8d71e8e196beb51803dba76495858e=Such a discovery must have weighed heavy on the minds of the citizens, as it still does even today. It is a hard life, when you must leave all behind in search of your ascent to god, as a writer, Lalo, remarks in 1788;\n\n\"I have been mistreated by many women for my skinny looks. I have had no success in the Boros and find myself at the Cloistrum, trying to match the other men. As for other aspects of ascent, they shall have to wait, for otherwise there will be no time in the day when I am able to write.\"
codex.1286fbd1344c297459a267a0b3c5c794=Lalo's exact commitments as a writer are not known. But by this time a system of job division was already in place. Stonemasons and carpenters would for example, exchange places for large parts of their careers. Generally exchanges only took place between similar \"classes\" of jobs. While these may seem relatively minor allowances, it anticipates the mid-third millennium, some seven-hundred years later, in which the most famous such story emerges;\n\nAlquin Hue, 8th of the Gallish month Srib, in the year 2507.    \n\"At first the news was terrible, but it quickly became wonderful. The people of Agbana had elected a mayor. But this mayor had formerly been an athlete! Not from a noble family, or a university education. No, instead an athlete. \"Why not,\" they said. Why not indeed!\"\n\nAnd so it continued. Equality became the essence of Saborianism: \"We are all gods, and must help each other reach Aetherium.\"\n \nIt was not until much later that the Rising Place was fully understood. Yet the Gallish \"discovery\" of Atlas in the late 27th century presupposes that no other peoples knew of the stones until that moment, which is simply not the case. There was no need for us to make crude examinations of the stone with which we already held a deep bond.
codex.9d630695a45198573bbd823919a4c743=By the 2750s, construction of the Stalk in Redusa and other famous enlightening landmarks, like the Grey Bridge in Momoros was well underway, with many Citizens having the honour of being contributors. Some help from the Pilipai was recompensed in food and good living. The best of them were even awarded citizenship. \n\nOnce the Stalk had been built, it created a focus for Saborian life and self-worship. Citizens flocked to see it from the other cities, though they would be asked to return home within the month.\n\nWhat was probably most intriguing about the Stalk, was how well god manifest itself in the upper part of the disc. The wings of apotheon seemed impossibly precarious, with its two freestanding towers of perfect white.
codex.548fe2ed3d6f11e999813deb92832c34=Thus the Golden Age began in Sabor, and peace reigned, as it still does approaching the third millennium. Part of the reason for this security is the view taken towards outsiders, as our incumbent Premier Einkornus recently stated;\n\n\"We may look at their [Other nations of Foundation] best ideas and make them our own. But we shall never lose what it is to be Saborian.\"\n\nIn particular there have always been trouble with two peoples. The brutes to the south, known as the Bandini, and the interferences of the Verdubans. Regarding the Verdubans, a scholar commenting as long ago as 2300 said;\n\n\"If they were worth an invasion, it'd have happened by now, because they properly deserve it.\"\n\nAs for the Bandini, what more can be said that hasn't already? They have been a menace since the very first Saborians were forced to defend our rightful home, and have a selfish madness that seems inherent in their race, loving money and other such barbarities. \n\n<The rest of this book is lost>

That is to say, the Tarrery, marching full of life beyond round stone dwellings surrounded by stick fences, out into a terrible blizzard. How cold it is, where the warm sea doesn't lap. But they are resolute, because they have one another. Their long whaling spears wobble in their hands as they clamber into skyrafts - former seafaring vessels, that now use Atlas. They are able to rise and fall upon the whales they hunt at their leisure.\r\n\r\n\"Life is easier now,\" said one, in a voice alternating between gruff and shrill, \"but ours are still the old ways.\"\r\n\r\nOf course he means that they never kill a whale for sport, nor the sacred white wolf neither. But if they must make a kill, then they offer gentle thoughts to the animal, and ask for forgiveness from the spirits in the moments before the spear is thrown. They waste no part of the creature, since in such a barren expanse, they must make use of anything and everything.

We hereby commemorate this gesture, which has brought now a hundred years of prosperity and peace upon us. Long may it remain so.\r\nEquality. Freedom. We are gods.

Of course, this amounts to nothing really, in a larger sense. Therefore, I can't agree with Panyana's views, and would reckon that if not entirely flat, Foundation is the shape of a curved scale, like those found on the little armoured ones with tails. Or perhaps like a kite that billows somewhat with air. As I have said before, the likelihood is that beyond the perimeter of cartography (as it stands) is an endless expanse of ocean, since this is what has been reported by those that have lived to tell the tale.\n\nBefore I bow out, I'd like to thank my students, and hope that the closure of Redusa is not as imminent as it seems.

I knew I must bring the tribes together at a summit. \r\n\r\nI sent my best woman to the Tamoe, asking after their leader, Srit-Taka. Srit-Taka agreed to a summit, and sent her best seeker south to rouse the Intucki chief Mal-Er, then on to the snakemen in the west, where the forest is thickest. Once the snakehead had agreed, he said he knew where to find the Queen of the Shamoe, who was only half-human. \r\n\r\nThe summit would be held in the mown grove of cottonwood, where the valley of flowers sweeps steeply from the bluebird's shrine, which follows from the stack of white stones that the snakes infest, then follows to the webs of the spider-women, down again, into the cinder-yard and then claypits, and up old smoke hill to the edge of Capulca, where the sea is first seen.

The stars gave us no sign, and we knew we must each decide for ourselves.\r\n\r\nFinally the day arrived. Those voting for spreading word of a cure would mark the stone with a circle. Those voting against with a cross. Each would cover their mark with a broad leaf. When all had marked the stone, the leaves would be removed and the vote counted. Each would then make the case for their mark, so that the matter was closed in their minds.

Once I had burned our findings, myself and the others must undergo the memory ritual - an experience so painful it would clear our minds of what we knew, or prevent us from speaking of it.\n\nThe summit now explained their vote.\n\n\"My people have no need of the cure,\" said Tally-Tee of the snakemen. \n\n\"I feel sad for the children who die of the bite, but I respect this brave decision,\" said Srit-Taka of the Tamoe. \n\n\"You are all standing in the way of progress. If we have it, why not use it? We could keep it a secret among ourselves!\" said Mal-Er of Intucki, but it was too late for that now.\n\n\"These lands are sacred. Those that come to exploit, they are who would benefit most, not us, who have always lived beside the snake,\" said Gri-Liif.\n\nI raised five fingers for \"yes\", as I thought Queen Gri-Liif of the Shamoe spoke true. I removed my mask of medicine, for it was not in keeping for the lie we would now swear upon.\n\n\"Then we are agreed. I am with you Gri-Liif. If they do not fear Koinos, they will come here in their thousands, looking for Atlas, and there will be nothing we can do to stop them.\"

We had many exchanges, but our knowledge of Atlas trumped theirs, and the first deal was made. \n\nOf course then the Unity knocked at our door, since the Warlocks had heard of our agreement with Sabor. They had scientists too, but no formal institutions, and grew to rely upon us.

codex.94f8e21eff3df0686ddff6b6c10e77c9=For many years the Fasio pistol club offered me salvation. I had the chance to perfect my shooting, and meet good friends along the way. \n\nThings at the club had recently become awkward, the new president wasn't Chabutian but Mellifluan, and seemed to want to reform the club into something wishy-washy. She was threatening to ban using live ammunition for goodness' sake! It was a good time to get away, and I think the situation prompted Gup's outburst. \n\nGup wasn't a good friend, but had been an ally at the club. He was from Verduba. Everyone knows Verdubans are nice people, but Gup wasn't, and that's why I liked him. In fact, he seemed to hate Verdubans. \n\"We're so obliging and charitable. If only we could help ourselves instead, and stop meddling in other people's business.\"\nI thought he might be referring to the recent incidents involving Vinicotian cannibals. \n\"I want to go somewhere and shoot some moving targets,\" he said, \"if we go far enough away, no-one from the club'll find out.\"\n\"A few Goatbears?\" I said with a nervous laugh. I hoped he had not been having darker thoughts.\n\"Yeah, why not?\" he said, to my relief. \nWe went up and set our rudder east. \n\nGoatbears, well, I didn't believe they were real. Whatever we found, I hoped it was really unique, like the tusked head of a boar. Perhaps it would be so impressive when we got it back to the club, they'd give us the presidency, and things could get back to normal. \n\nThe last thing I expected was to be fighting for our lives in the dark.
codex.687ca1e84638fadd62afe2142eaa5e91=We had a few disagreements on the way to Pin, and things came to a head.\r\n\"What are we doing? Goatbears aren't even real. Let's find something else up there to shoot.\"\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\"I don't know like a herdsman or something.\"\r\nI was appropriately horrified, and began to steer the ship back around.\r\n\"What are you doing?\" he said angrily.\r\n\"Taking us back.\"\r\n\"We've come this far, you're not turning us back.\"\r\n\"I'm taking us back,\" I repeated, at which point he flung himself toward the helm, and tried to wrest the controls from my grasp. \r\nBefore long we were in a tangle on the floor, grappling and punching wildly at one another. The ship began to plunge downward like a humpback whale. The air around us drew closer until it was murky, and all that could be seen above was the faint imprint of the egg-grey sun.\r\nI kept swinging at his face and hitting, but they were weak efforts. He saved up his swings, but caught me hard. So it continued, until we were both exhausted. The ship was terminally out of control, and we were helpless to stop it.
codex.9922fc3c8c5abd9f98b8714a21d99f88=It creaked, lurched and juddered, and then a great roar followed, as it tore through what I thought was a rock face. Great clods of earth drummed on the hull, and we put our hands above our heads for protection. Finally the noise stopped, and the engines cut out. In the gloom I could only see the whites of Gup's eyes. \r\n\"Where are we?\"\r\n\"Truce?\" he said.\r\n\"If you want,\" I said.\r\nAfter a few moments I saw a flicker on the periphery of the crash site. Whispering noises. Then movement. A shot rang out. Gup had fired.\r\n\"What are you doing!?\" I said, but he fired again. Whilst he was reloading, I saw one of the creatures come straight for us, then dart behind a boulder. They were gigantic ants, running upright on two legs. Gup hit one, and it flinched but the pistol shot ricocheted harmlessly off its carapace. There were more of them, all getting closer. I said, \"Gup, I'm leaving,\" but he wasn't listening, he was having too much fun. I ran and ran, and didn't look back until I reached a low rise. \r\nThe last I saw of Gup, the giant ants were swarming over his body, thrusting their lance-like arms into his sides. 
codex.7577196e4caa17f95ed70185ecf68d15=My legs were caked in mud, and I was bleeding. I found a haven, a wall of dried out mud under that arced up like the crest of a wave. Ahead an aqueduct teetered, since our ship had made a hole in it. This must have been the source of the ants consternation - if indeed they were angry at all, Gup had never given them a choice. How fascinating it might have been to converse with them. They were fearsome, but walked on two legs much like us, and built structures much like our own.\n\nI knew now that this was the Night Lands, where the heavy clouds rule. Barren mudflats. It has plentiful water, but little light and little growth.\nAfter three days, I managed to get to the western coast, and to my amazement saw an unbroken line of blue sky beyond.\n\nThe brown sand was as frigid as the water. I made a fire, and clung on to the hope that someone might pass by. \nI unstrapped the gun and fired it at a nearby concon, whose white milk exploded. Then I made a hole in the sand, and buried the smithers of concon and my gun together, vowing never to touch so terrifying a weapon again.

codex.2bcca8bd7594e36737deb0ca37747a4c=An academic pamphlet\n\nI have tried to recover shreds of the Mesa-Bandini language from before the invasion in the year 559. Unfortunately the Saborian expurgation of it was so thorough, that there is next to nothing left. \n\nOne or two words from Mesa-Bandini remain in use. \"Popel\" is still the Bandini word for shield, as for example, those great golden discs adorning the palace (and are themselves symbolic of Bandini oppression among Darat's native population). \"Niva\" is the word for a small dog - they do not use the Saborian \"Neera\" which is common in modern Bandinian. \n\nThe Bandini learned Saborian by necessity, and much of modern Bandinian comes from the same place. Still, by nature or nurture it seems they have a great aptitude for languages in general. Many times visiting Darat or Drissa, street entrepreneurs have bellowed first in the Great Marsha tongue, for they guess I might be stocky enough, then Mellifluan or Chabuti, before they eventually discover I'm Verduban. It is no cheap trick, for they proceed to conduct the rest of their business in Verduban, seldom wavering on a syllable, and using rich, sometimes obscure vocabulary along the way...\n\n...recently there have been extraordinary reports that the Mesa-Bandinian language flourishes in the nooks and crannies of Darat like shadowy currency. It's an assertion that is hard to prove. The reports come from several different sources, tradesmen, visitors to the city and suchlike, all of whom stating they heard strange syllables and utterances that bears no similarity to Saborian. Pure conjecture, but there's often no smoke without a fire.\n\n<the text burbles on about links between semiotics and modern Bandini architecture>
codex.ed1fe3c54465ebaa33b84577e36c853c=They call me Banton. If it in your will to let me speak, read on, and I will bring pleasure. Reason: I only have me beloved Pati-Pikk and a suitcase of clothes whose fashion seem trivial. But trivial is what I be - a jester, a Rammybobble of Mandala. I take no happiness in no serious busyness of melancholy. \n\nOf course there not a pebble left of Melliflua, or of Chabuti neither. Them people was in a state of lowness. Yet we refugees was brought to Capulca aboard a Mellifluan dromond, strung aft to fore in pennants and flags like some rainbow. A young m'am went to take them down, so shaming she say. But to me they came at a time of need, love is what we need. Anyway, there nothing left of home, unless you count memories, of which I guard my share. But I better scribe them down, 'for I perish and all be forgotten.\n\nBanton is tired of the streaming eyes, grim lamentin' by the fireside. Life weren't all right great before the apocalypse, y'know? So I put my name to a book of Cha-Boots - dem naughty rhymes if you will. If we laugh, we celebrate. Then follows the real feeling, not the bucket-fulls of wet pity, and we realise, fruit's still ripe.\n\nHere me self-portrait:\n\nThere once was an eloquent Banton,\nBorn in a troublesome canton,\nThe ground gave way,\nAnd he flew away,\nThat lucky old storyman Banton.
codex.6eb132b667a322224309ee328b4d5005=At the gardens, we have been having open and frank discussions. But today a pair of Godhands appeared at the back of the crowd. We were unable to speak our true feelings for fear of reprisal. \r\n\r\nMolin is a wonderful cook, there can be no doubt. We save our stamps for a taste of his magic, we learn from him, we love him... and we are not alone. Everyone in Foundation has heard the name, even Bandinians. He has never dabbled in politics, never taken liberties (though he could demand any favour he desired from the Stalk). Yet he cannot be god.
codex.9180f7de0c77da2608709ddfc33bf612=Next month will be the occasion of his hundredth birthday, which he'll celebrate like every other birthday - working solidly in his kitchen. But to every Saborian, this must surely be a reminder of his contradiction. He is twice the age of any other citizen, yet he is afforded the same privileges.   \n\nThe trouble is, no-one can imagine life without him - he has no understudies, no competition. His knowledge and craft only seems to improve with age, and not only is he perfectly capable of looking after himself (as we are so often told the elderly cannot), he works harder than everyone else, and produces better results. While his un-Saborian attitudes are well-documented, in particular his love of other cuisines, he has taught Sabor to love these dishes more than their own.
codex.bf697c4dcf8b1ecbf1bfd47382bab4fc=It makes you wonder how many more of us might have his talent, if we were able to live beyond the rising. If we felt we had the time to master one thing, not divide ourselves between a hundred things, none of which are of our choosing, how would we fare? It is said that Molin's first assignment at fifteen was as a mason (for which we now use Bandinians or Pilipai), and that was where he learned hard work. One day someone tried a lunch he'd knocked up, and declared it extraordinary. The following year he was reassigned to a kitchen of the cafe above Redusa (We now know it as Molin's Cafe though his name does not appear anywhere at its frontage) where he has remained ever since.
codex.0bb371fb58c26e012eb2860290787267=Foreword (To a biography of Zubin)\r\n\r\nMy time has come, and I wanted a few words committed to paper. The rest of this volume has been faithfully and expertly accounted by Gartias in her own style, but this foreword is mine.  \r\n\r\nMany desire to be Utopianist. It is my honour and good fortune to have held that position, and I thank Aetherium for steering me that far. But every victory and defeat beyond the moment I first placed my hat on the hatstand, is solely down to me. \r\n\r\nMany candidates, on becoming Utopianist, are quickly forced to resign. The pressure is there from the moment you walk in the door, regardless of how long you spend dreaming and preparing for it, or how much knowledge you possess ahead of the task. What the role requires is hard work, and even then, my advice for anyone wishing to try it out for size, is that hard work may not be enough. \r\n\r\nBut... as long as you have conscience, you can succeed - as some say I did. Though naturally, I think there are a million things I could have done better. \r\n\r\nTake the matter of the rising age. If the law did not exist, I imagine a citizen might live a hundred or more years. Under the ruling, perfect balance exists. My regret is that agreeing the practice took too long, and the door was left open to question when it should have been shut.
codex.06c8ea16b93d1dc1f6869945d8b8d9a7=Suffice to say, it went (forgive me) beyond faith. \n\nAt its heart, the motion was a form of population control, at a time my \"conscience\" began to surface. I knew that if Redusa or Momoros ever grew too big, the bubble would burst, the earth would shift, and our towers would crumble. We had to be grateful for what we had, take nothing for granted. \n\nIt remains my belief that humility and modesty are the foundations of godliness. We accept that in exchange for a life that is short and sweet, we must not outstay our welcome. \n\nSpare now a thought for the Pilipai, whose lives are seldom well-lived. Yes, they may live long, but the concessions of a non-citizen are many, and there will be no place for them in Aetherium come the end. It is for them as much as us, that our cities must remain small. This is our perfect symbiosis.
codex.f4ec6d7d254158382d125fc4b016b8b5=And what of genius, men and women who might only improve with age? Was it hard to see them go, or to exile them to the lands of the Pilipai when they refused to put down the brush? Of course it was. But their bitterness shall never undermine their achievements.\n\nHow can we prevent such unique knowledge being thrown to the wind? By bringing those of rising age into education during their final years, so that their knowledge can be transferred. I myself have been seconded to the assembly, teaching the young thinkers all I know. Besides, Aetherium guides us, the voices of the risen. Each age flows seamlessly from one to the next. \n\nOn a final note, it is with great delight I see my ecological legacy continues. Our gardens of delight burst with colour in spring, and the sweet aroma of the flowers is what living is all about. The Pilipai keep the river clean, and the grandest new city constructions are made in the aspect of nature, barren and bounteous as she may be. My work on this is my proudest achievement. Gods do not deface Foundation, they are one with it. \nWe are gods.\n\nZubin \nUtopianist  2795-2811

I am so sorry, and I wish I could tell you in person so that I don't seem like a coward.\r\n\r\nI hold my knees for all of us, that we might see each other again, somewhere.\r\n\r\nYour Mateo.

codex.a015e9fed3fe9b3e03e0c8491d47530c=Gallery catalogue as follows;\n\nBust of Agonon, textile and clay, \nMuldoon. 2788.\n        \nThis remarkable form, representing Agonon's misery at the moment of eternal interment, received a bittersweet reception in Muldoon's hometown of Ternana. The expression of Agonon is said to embody creation, preservation, and destruction, which are so central to Mellifluan belief. While some admire Muldoon's interpretation of the story (the best-known regarding the centipede god), many resent the cheap idolatry the sculpture invokes. They argue that Muldoon (literally) places Agonon upon a pedestal, when his adultery is the last thing that should be celebrated. Others claim Muldoon's work is mercenary, and that he was commissioned to produce it by the Empress of Kioki for a grand fee. Whatever his reasons, it remains one of the most iconic works of the Golden Age.
codex.ed77c865107ad11283a3991fabe137c4=\"The Verdubans arrive to petition the Vinicoti regent.\" Oil on board. \n        Unknown painter. c. 1722 \n        \nThis ancient, and wonderfully preserved painting is likely to be a recollection of the Verduban visit to the shores of Vinicoti, rather than one painted in situ. The Verduban cause c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre here is the lifestyle of the Vinicotian cannibals, who at the time it was painted, had grown increasingly feverous at the sight of Verduban ships. This was largely because they saw embroidered images of body parts on the sails of passing Verduban ships, and took it to be an omen of their deliciousness.\n\nFollowing a number of incidents, the Verdubans wanted a guarantee of safe passage through the strait, and sent a negotiator to Vinicoti who was well-versed in island dialects. The story goes that having received a warm welcome, the Verdubans trooped on inland in the hope of meeting the cannibal ruler, and were never to be seen again. \n\nThe painter makes clever use of light to signify the hubristic optimism of the Verduban mariners coming ashore, white sails of ears, feet and hands flying in honour of the ice god, whilst capturing a sense of their impending tragedy.

codex.c8ffc6ca09820bdae6a11fd14a063066=We landed on an island today and they let me out to look for meat. Saul was standing on the edge shouting at some of the boys looking for things under the island. I think I've had enough of Saul shouting because I bumped into him and he fell off. He kept going down and didn't come back. The boys didn't say anything to me for a while but after I made the sauce in the evening they all came and got some so I think they don't mind.
codex.4b6e6f7f05d4691fb2d704b90d10e35d=Maggot came back today and this time he seemed really happy! He kept laughing and grabbing my shoulders. I gave him some sauce and he said he really liked it.
codex.6dde69c3d6066ac15db7acd680d0bd59=I am Warlock of the Dragon-Dog, I have it in my blood. It surges through my body, saying \"no-one can bleed you\".\r\n\r\nIt pains me that I live for the Empress, yet am denied entering her service. When will a Dragon-Dog be allowed to serve her again?
codex.124c3b3670112989a00221b1b15ef7bd=Father asked me to make the pilgrimage to the low-town, as he once did. The visit troubled me greatly.\r\n\r\nWe promised a young woman her children would be safer out on the plain. She said the city was her home. She said she'd not rely on the goodwill of others, and must earn the right to eat. \r\n\r\nShe said she would follow no Empress, and spoke of the heathen Goddess, the \"true\" Empress who loves the poor. \r\n\r\nI understood her disappointment, and promised to visit again when the children weren't in the mines.
codex.ede7b9a7c19c07040a94793d6da6706c=Father says that he too loves this \"true\" Empress. \r\n\r\n\"Why not tell me?\" I asked him.\r\n\r\n\"For fear you would be ashamed. Your ardour is deep for the court, though they ignore your letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"But father, I always put you and the Dragon-Dog before her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I will give you the book. But I fear tales of injustice will bring out the worst in you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it! I do not care!\" I said, and father gave me the Book of Soil to read. The words on those pages enlightened me.\r\n\r\nThen I went to Wellah, to the shrine among the cypress, and I met with a man with a pet mouse. He spoke for the true Empress, and what he said confirmed all that I already knew, that the Empress I lived for was false, and that there could only be one.\r\n\r\n\"One day there will be justice in Ishgiru,\" I told him. He said I must be the one to act, or no-one would.
codex.b51c9d3f7afb2dde1f0e7bd2a0533cb9=It sickens me. They pay them near nothing. I wish to strike these mine-keepers, but the true Empress does not command it.\r\n\r\nThe little children fear me, but I am more afraid of them. They tell me stories of their gods, of  the tribes of Koinos, and distant lands of Foundation I have have never known. I shiver at the coming darkness of which they speak. I see them when I can, but the one true Empress has business for me to see to in the upper city.
codex.0134833329a2d36eacfbca41882cd517=I went to the rubble today, where the rumble broke, and Sini and her children lived. I looked for them, finding nothing but their little book of writings. I put it in my satchel. \r\n\r\nAll that is left of Ten-Rui is rotten. The Nabobs care not for the fallen city, and I am not sure the False Empress even knows it is lost. \r\n\r\nNow for my duty, as it is written in the Book of Soil. I am the Dragon-Dog and I claim my fifty men for the True Empress. But I claim them as much for the children of Ten-Rui who have suffered such short and terrible lives.
codex.35a1f3d7451a843ecc41ea23193fec23=First the letter and then the crane squeals to the Empress. This is not coincidence. It is Gloam's doing. He wants me out. He wants us all out, so that he is her only counsel.\r\n\r\nWhen it is time, I must break the glass, and escape the zoo. That is if things go awry. It is dangerous being me. I must kill silently and fast, or it is I that shall be vulnerable. Go out, my little snakes, and be ruthless. Do it, and preserve our freedoms.\r\n\r\nI am green like the Empress' silks, but my eyes are yellowed with time and the sight of death. I dwell in a small glass case, watching and waiting. I coil about the tree branches within, feeling them out. \r\n\r\nGood spies never form bonds. I am concerned therefore at the progress of \"Selene\", once known as Leti Mabonie. She has formed an undesirable attachment to M after no time at all. She is smart in combat, there is no question, but if she has a weakness, it is that she is gullible in matters of the heart.\r\n\r\nI asked M if this was merely a brief dalliance of his, but he wasn't as quick to underplay it as I'd like. I have therefore asked him to drop the girl for both their sakes.
codex.a300c63b28c33b3686a84e67d7617f72=Oppeetobee Oracle, Ichthuna 3026.\n\nThe resilience of the young man is extraordinary. His company, Eagle-eye, has only been trading the brobbins and grubbins of war for five months, and yet its stellar brilliance has caught the eye of the most serious corporations of Ten-Rui. \n\nLast month Horris Feather had the audacity to turn down an offer of 70,000,000 Ishgiruan Spirits for his share of Eagle-eye, a company for which he has produced all the master designs himself. The bidder, Dawnfire, is the largest ship manufacturer in Ishgiru - a testament to the genius of young feather, who is only thirteen years of age. \n\nI visited the factory on the edge of Oppeetobee, where great chunks of forest had recently been felled to extend the boy's airfield.\n\nMe: Is it strange to think you own all this, and you're only 13?\nHF: Not in the slightest. Others call me an upstart, but I'd like to see them try and invent and innovate as I do.\nMe: Are you referring to the takeover bid by Dawnfire?\nHF: Dawnfire, more like Fawndire (he laughs).\n\nI watch as he interrupts our talk to squawk some instructions to his factory floor. Anywhere else his unbroken voice might elicit mockery, but his workers only increase their urgency, eyes glued to their benches. \n\nAfter that, the noise of the factory drowns us out, and Feather is so preoccupied he can't focus. I bid him farewell, and wonder if I have just been lucky enough to meet a genius, one that can not only put Oppeetobee on the map, but serve the Unity against the growing threat in the west.

I meant they're like icebergs for the skyships to avoid, like sea-ships before Atlas.\"\r\n\"Only in the far south,\" she said, \"far beyond Koinos, in the bitter cold, where no-one lives.\"\r\n\r\nMy best friend at Gwendolier Institute is Em, she is already an expert on radio signals. She likes clouds too, the way they look, but she says they interfere with the radio signals. She said some of the Sky hulks fell over when the signals went hazy. Reaalllly slowly of course.\r\n\r\nThere are no boys here to distract us, only clouds and dreams, drifting on by.

codex.36fb85e778a8bafdcf0c1f08ebe7ae82=An Account of the Uprisings in Conos.\r\n\r\nOnce the quakes happened in Darat, things changed in Sabor.\r\n\r\nIt began on the night of Kip 22nd. As Kip's darkness bulged, so did the eyes of the guests at the Hotel Madrigal in Conos, as bricks and stones stoved-in the windows. A great clamour could be heard from the street all around, as men and women climbed in over broken glass, and began to loot and destroy the hotel.\r\n\r\nHostages were made of the guests and staff, and their entitlement books were pilfered. The terrorists were largely migrant Bandinians, but more surprisingly, some were Pilipai.     \r\n\r\nGodhands were immediately dispatched from Redusa to support those already in Conos. They were prepared to do anything to halt the assault, but after Darat, their opponents had even less to lose.
codex.1a176091cc0c1e009a575d8a4f723c06=The next day, the flames died down beneath a rainburst unlike any anyone had ever seen in the desert. The Godhands picked through the damp and gutted remains of the hotel. A few, but not all, of the hostages survived, and were recovering under blankets. The smell of ash filled the air.     \r\n\r\nThe last thing government wanted was for news of the event to spread. From beneath my blanket however, I was recording everything. Including my own will, in case I should be \"chalked out\" simply for being a witness.\r\n\r\nI watched as human remains were stealthily removed, bundled into sheets, and taken out to sea - they hoped that would be the end of it. \r\nBut it wasn't.
codex.d071e4de3555e5c47d3b31ba7c603741=Over the following weeks, Conos was rocked by several more attacks. Bandinians, Pilipai,  Verduban altruists, anyone that had been angered by the events in Darat, now took up arms against the citizens. \r\n\r\nThe Godhands could only be seen to be taking reasonable measures. Something on this scale, by its very nature demonstrated the failure of utopianism and its hypocrisy. The city was overrun, graffiti daubed everywhere, citizens killed or forced out, leaving everything they'd ever known behind.\r\n\r\nBut by the beginning of the month of Kif, the Stalk had withdrawn the Godhands from Darat, and unshackled the many Bandini they had working the mines. Goners with dead blue faces and broken skin.
codex.2798c8db5006b68151261cb59766294a=Had the Stalk finally given in to the volcano of pressure - the revolution in Darat and Conos?\r\nHad they ever.\r\n\r\nThey left Bandinia because there was nothing left to take. They left Conos behind because it was always the furthest from god. Discussions had moved on. Now it would be mining in Melliflua, or anywhere else there was a source of the stone.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 3025, Conos was a ruin held by Bandinians and Pilipai, fighting over rubble, and no-one seemed to care.
codex.2a126516568a215fcd091badaeddebd8=I embody calm and patience. The warm sea washes between my toes, as I collect sandy baitworms. I have been collecting along the crab coast for six years, and now I enter the second phase of my training.\r\n\r\nCrabcatching, if you don't already know, is a culinary art. It first became prominent during the Chabuti early kingdom, an era so they say, when we were as great as any civilisation. Sadly our oligarchy of Ephors, which had accomplished so much, grew corrupt and lazy. We became culturally and materially impoverished, were driven to piracy and sleazy circuses, and our star paled. \r\n\r\nTo many, it is time-consuming and quaint, but Crabcatching is just about all there is left of that time. I hope to master it, so that I may pass on its secrets to future generations.\r\n  \r\nMy peach-coloured garments are starched to give the effect of exoskeletal rigidity, where there is actually none. So, I drop to my knees smoothly. My costume ruffles with a practiced and exact movement. This way, the crabs do not know me from their own kind. \r\n\r\nI haven't caught a crab yet, but my master assures me the time will soon come for me to try. The horde will come when the waters cool, thousands upon thousands of them.\r\n\r\nI hand my master the worms I have collected. She puts one in her shrivelled mouth and chews. She gives the merest nod. I have handled them well.
codex.13d632fe2c61c660e06c6f46076ba05b=I spoke to the foreman, a citizen, and the conversation went something like this;\r\n\r\nForeman: \"You don't look busy, what's going on?\"\r\n\r\nMe: \"So I have an nine-bit egg-cam to install today, but the slide cranks haven't been fixed in place by the crank team yet.\"\r\n\r\nForeman: \"Yeah I don't want excuses, I need you to do your bit on this today, or you'll fall behind on the prototype side.\"\r\n\r\nMe: \"No I get that, and I don't want to fall behind, but I can't do anything until the crank team have done their bit.\"\r\n\r\nForeman: \"I don't care about that, just get on and do your job.\"\r\n\r\nMe: \"Fine!\"\r\n\r\nSo I spend the whole day trying to pre-install the egg-cam, even though I'll have to take it all off again later, only to discover the cranks still haven't done their bit. So when the foreman is off at the cloistrum next morning, I wander down to the hangar, and confront them.
codex.19a4548561d25a829c76cdde947d2856=Me: \"Guys, you're taking way too long with the damn slide cranks for the sky hulk.\"\r\n\r\nCrank #1: \"Hello Tereta, have you come to show us your bim-bims?\"\r\n\r\nThat spun me off so much, and I was already spun out, so I hit him over the head with my spanner. A fight broke out with the other two and I kicked their hides. The foreman put me in the compound with the Bandini, and I'm cutting Atlas with the slaves all day long.\r\n\r\nOld Bandini man: \"Got anything love?\"\r\n\r\nMe: \"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\nOBM: \"What about that little book and pen in your pocket?\"\r\n\r\nMe: \"How do you know about that?\" \r\n\r\nOBM: \"I can smell the glue binding it together.\"\r\n\r\nMe (to the guard): \"For the gods, please get me out of here!\"\r\n\r\nOBM: \"Give me one page. All I need is one page, come on, give it to me.\"
codex.dc4c2a9e7415b0330d98485647e946ad=The only thing we Pilipai have over the Bandini these days is our sanity. \r\nAnyway when I finally did get out of the compound, I found the foreman was chasing the cranks, because they still hadn't done a load of stuff they were supposed to. \r\n\r\nThe reason being that they didn't really understand the sky hulk blueprints, because neither did the foreman, and when he'd originally gone through it he hadn't explained it to them properly, and that was because the translations from Gallish to Saborian were garbage. \r\n\r\nThe quality of these designs seems to be getting worse and worse, and it's making my life a nightmare! 
codex.de5e24dc1cb31e7bab39eec18151c55b=Well, I'm probably the only one who actually has dealings with the so-called \"ant-men\". Truth is, it makes them sound like a sub-human species roving about the place. But of course they aren't.\r\n\r\nI, Nabob Trelown, benefactor of the much-loved Shoemaker stilt team, winners of the third, sixteenth and forty-first Ten-Rui challenges, am a long-time friend of the people of the Night Lands, praise Dinoue.\r\n\r\nThe Night Lands are unusual, naturally. A bleak grey mudflat on which little may grow. In the dim light, it maybe easy to mistake the shadowy shapes of its people for termites, their industrious ways, their tall delicate hive-like buildings hewn into canyons of mud. \r\n\r\nNot least the similarity to ants extends to the clothing they wear. Their hats have very long thin plumes of the migratory Avowettle, a bird with a curled beak for probing the mud. From afar these look like antennae or some such.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Night Lands are happy to exchange gold, which is abundant here, for food. Little of remark can be eaten here but the honey of the mud bee. The Night Landers refuse to eat fish, but enjoy wines and sweetened curd. I believe their language has things in common with the Tarrery over the mountains.
codex.18a7e0bf17839d33e4be56051c2b3c73=Through a little copse, in a little hole, in the Great Marshas, live the Deep Marshas. \r\n\r\nTheir cauldron soups are velvety green like their faces. Their eyes are yellow, and their hair is slicked into dark rivers. They swing heavy with old bones. \r\n\r\nWe sometimes see them in Darnik. They bring us the soup and we give them frogs to make it with. \r\n\r\nThey say we Great Marshas are strange, which we take on the chin. But none are akin to the Deep Marshas.\r\n\r\nThey speak of the \"marsh-below-the-marsh\", and commune with algae in a language too strange to utter. They tell us the marsh is unhappy, that it becomes a mire. They tell us the marsh is angry, and that the storm will swirl up through us, like a Kraken unspurling all of its arms.

Some postcards have been exposed to an extreme heat source, but fortunately all of the text survives)\r\n\r\nLovely view from incline of blackened mountain slopes, nut-vittle good, but spartan - not up to Chabuti standards! Enjoying clean room and raw sweet lemons on terrace. Scorpions a menace. Landlady nice but wears obnoxious hat - so broad it pokes me in the eye as she passes up the stairwell. Theorising about deities and interviewing Gall. Should be further news soon. One thing clear, seems no single Gall holds same gods or beliefs, but usually one of the seventeen - you know, as in the months of the year. Many shrines in disrepair, though Gall don't care, they say it's impossible to control the world beyond the self. They say if these are forgotten relics, then that is what they should remain. Next week flying to Panyana, meeting Garnian, Professor of Religious Intrigue. Will compare notes.
codex.d99c887c00092dfa0d6a779870e2bcb0=University most beautiful and interesting. Garnian not there. Went along coast by skyship, black shale like treacle. Garnians's house secluded. Found her to be a gentle and welcoming intellect. Was cleaning her home, made me wait outside the door while she swept, then I was asked to remove my shoes. \r\nOnce we began talking, she had more questions than I! Seemed pious, in a personal way. That is key, she says; Gallish gods give guidance, not answers. She says science is never fixed, or a certainty, but instead a lifetime's struggle toward truth.\r\n\"Do not lose the race for the door. Use your elbows, use your knees, but do not use your feet and hands.\"\r\nThis saying ascribed to Perimola, goddess of boundaries. Self-centred, but explicitly so. Would be very un-Saborian. Strangely there are no religious texts among Gall religious artefacts - Garnian says that their credo has passed by word of mouth, like the rebus puzzle they use to protect their findings, down through generations. It will never be committed to paper.
codex.a58359c9ef6bb545eda65d962792fac7=Took long walk up esplanade and blackstone steps to sacred mount plateauing into beautiful grassy fortress. Stone arch-like structures everywhere, and Gallish visitants using them like doors to their futures. At first all look similar, but each is unique to a god. These gods are not the place from which we have come - but the nebula of our destiny. Sits oddly with Gallish scientific bent, but then again, seems to drive them harder in pursuit of knowledge.\r\nSaw a young Gall walk beneath an arch muttering. She repeated the loop several times.
codex.ced7ae418a78de6a49a1dae351a650fa=Notes on arches found;\nIchthuna - Water. Arch and fountain. No glyphs. \n\nPerimola - Plain stone arch. Combed gravel garden with small wall. Goddess of Boundaries. Text as follows; \"Do not lose the race for the door. Use your elbows, use your knees, but do not use your feet and hands.\"\n\nLorni - Plants or Vegetation. Ogballs and a Colliflorn adorning arch. Often placed near Icthuna to indicate plants' need for water.\n\nSmall - God of Insectoids. Stone Beetle standing on two legs protrudes from keystone of arch. Youthful voracity. Equivalent to Mellifluan god Motus?\n\nLopus - Movement possibly? No arch. Stone statues dressed in garments that blow in the wind.\n\nQang - Luxury, excess. A very circular head observed smiling. Depictions of Nut-vittles, Whale oil. Valuable offerings placed here. Sinister markings - beware lethal anti-theft countermeasures nearby.   \n\nSrib - Sun deity. Large metallic feminine Sun, mounted on tall wood pole. \n\nCob - Suggestive ornament - possibly love deity (entwined bodies), though hard to tell. \n\nDibi - Easy to mistake for Qang or Lorni. Some Vegetation on fan shrine (as with Lorni) but keystone of arch is rack of meat (venison?). Deduction - God of food.\n\nNuess - Babies, washing rack and fireplace. God of menfolk and the home.\n\nKip - Night. Star-strewn arch. The goddess is represented by the green moon. \n\nKif - Newly discovered - God of Victory. Statue with crab held above head. Few complete examples remain.\n\nSkrambau - An arch made with black stone. Marked with the symbol of curses and death - clarification needed. This is also the name the Gall give to big moon.\n\nWewe - God of Fire. Beware, floor unstable beneath arch, leading to lava lake. \n\n\\u00d6evel - Filth-smeared arch shrine. Ammonial residue. God of the privy?\n\nBabbo - Found near Ichthuna, Simple boat adornments. No glyphs/text. Conjecture - God of Seafaring and the maritime.\n\r\nGudo - Becat dice, Lallara, hoops and bells on arch. Deity of leisure or play.    \r\n\r\nSeventeen in total - same as our calendar year. Garnian says Gallish calendar universal now, and only Pekoe use a different telling of time, though ratfolk in Wahsili burrows do not mark it.\n

Verduba find not the Great Marsha odd, for they too love a mud sauna. The Marsha find not the Tarrery odd, for they too respect the ice. Tarrery find not Chabuti odd for they are also stony resolved. Chabuti find not Ishgiru odd, for they have custom and tradition. The Ishgiru find not the Pekoe odd, for they also worry about their health. The Pekoe find not the Karem odd, for both hold magics above all else. The Karem find not the Pin odd, for they too enjoy the hunt. The Pin find not the Wahsili odd, for they too, would sizzle in the hot sun. The Wahsili find not the Bandini odd, for desert life is a struggle just the same. The Bandini find not Melliflua odd because they share an enemy. The Mellifluans find not the Vinicoti odd, because they dress well. Vinicoti find not Sabor odd, because pirate spoils must be divided equally. So it is that no peoples find each other odd!

We have been working closely with the schools in Bandinia to help foster a much-improved educational system that includes professional teachers and high-quality learning materials and methodologies essential to Bandini economic growth and stability. Bandinia has one of the youngest populations in Foundation, making development for school-aged children a high priority. Please see the happy classroom photographs included. \n\nBeyond education, we have worked closely with the Darat planning committee to ensure that new constructions in Darat are safe, and can withstand the ongoing tremors there. Please see the photographs included. \n\nUnfortunately we are unable to allow foreign access to Bandinia at this time due to internal strife. Fortunately our civil police, the Godhands, are helping to restore Bandinia back to being a safe and productive place to live, with a young workforce that can realise its potential. \n\nPresident Telemon (on behalf of the Saborian Stalk Assembly)
codex.f642c87a624ce37518caa7f3c5348ffa=Dear Mother, \n\nYou must stop thinking of father, that whole episode was years ago. Jealousy is the most ungodly feeling. You're a Pilipus, he is a citizen. \nBut note, I still write to you! I am not merciless - I confess and accept my origins. What does it matter if I was born in the sticks? I proved my value, and became a citizen, and now I take that experience forward in my career. \n\nI have news. I have been appointed \"Economist\" in Redusa. It is a new assignment to commemorate the Stalk's construction. I am to wear green scarves, and to join the governing committee. If this means nothing to you, I understand, but for me this is as good as it gets.\n\nEverything we do now is with foreign parties. It will be my job to ensure that we always benefit from trade, preserving everything Saborian. Foreign states expect to trade in currency, but we of course, cannot. The worst thing would be to allow these outsiders to contaminate our way of life, to unbalance us. We are gods.\n\nInstead, we shall offer the abundance of the crescent; fruit, olives, minerals - the stuff at the bottom of your paridaiza mother! As to what they have to offer, I can think of little, for we have it all. Except perhaps a little more Atlas stone - that might be useful.

codex.57a27a82df60064c848bf1be77e75a08=Efflua is my favourite town. The white houses step-stoning from the ink-black shingle all the way up to the rolling common, where the children fly kites and sing songs. \r\nThe first thing you notice, is that no-one here is in the middle of life. The men are out at sea with the boats, their wives are in far away Panyana or else teaching the children. \r\n\r\nThe wise old dames sit out in the piazza, talking of University policy or of their former researches, looking over the beautiful marina and harbour. Then one of their husbands emerges from the smokery, a great cauldron in his rough-gloved hands. He is sprightly if aged, and watching him roll the cauldron on its base provides great entertainment for them. \r\n\r\nBut when he lifts the lid on the cauldron, they all delight in the aroma. Perfectly cooked white fish with spiced crumb and a touch of smoke. The breads they make come from ovens buried in the black rock. You can even taste the rock in their char.\r\n\r\nNo-one here is half as uptight as they are in Panyana. They're here to paddle in the warm sea, and dream of the gods under the arch at every little inlet and cove. \r\nThe best thing is to walk up to the black cove, it has wonderful fossils, and you see hundreds there, people are gathering stones as big as your head!

Under its boughs lie the steadfast heroines of Efflua's past, miniature arches, gates to the gods, erected in their honour.  \r\n \r\nUp the scree slope and away from the town proper, looking over an area of mottled scrub bouncing with crickets, is the headquarters of the Liaison Trustees. It feels at odds with the quaint town.\r\n\r\nPrimly dressed women, and the odd man, skirt the square briskly. But their faces are pained, they are universally melancholy, unfulfilled. For these are the students whose studies amounted to nothing, and in their desire to return to heady university days, adopted the Trustee positions that are both so near and so far from academia. They revel malevolently in what power they can exercise over Panyana, and take joy in belittling the academics wherever possible. \r\n\r\nYou can understand I suppose, since the academics are just as quick to scoff at the Liaison Trustees, thinking their interference a waste of precious time.

I mean, I should make it absolutely clear that looks aren't important when it comes to evaluating new students, but she really was different.\r\n\r\nI couldn't help but look at her legs, which were swaddled above the waste in loose sackcloth. She wore a large hat which she had pulled down as far as possible over her face, though we could see it was heavily painted underneath, and she had stuffed her blouse with ogballs for breasts. Her chosen subject for study was, \"Revelry in Vinicoti public houses, and the effect of enforced sobriety on hardened sky-mariners.\"

We were always in a new port. Most were written in Gallish, and I read a lot, provided they weren't under the Rebus.\"\r\n\r\nWe flinched at the word. It was taboo to talk openly of the Rebus at Panyana, and perhaps in that moment we should have twigged, but the interview skipped on, and we decided her topic was interesting, having little similar research in the archive. \r\n\r\nAs a senior figure in the social sciences field, our Professor Tummel of Mellifluan Baliandric studies sat beside me on the interview panel. She was born male, but always thought herself a woman. The charter of the University of Panyana is very clear on the matter; \"Only women may study at Panyana.\" That is why Miss Tummel has been welcomed with open arms. The candidate had gone quiet, and the interview very tense, when Professor Tummel decided to speak up. \r\n\r\n\"Please do not be offended, but may I ask a personal question?\"\r\n\r\nThe candidate waved her hand in accord.

It's the one with a vision of the Mount of Plenty on the inner jacket. A detailed map nearly three-hundred years old with every elevation, green swathe and oasis. It was a sacred place. Even back when I was growing-up, the lake was a paradise of wading Blue-beaks and Yellow-legged Parakons. That was before the diggers came.\r\n\r\nThey were trying to get at the stone, which surveyors said was deep inside the body of the Mount. The surveyors proved right, and more ships followed. Some of the folk from Cross Fields traded farming for digging, since diggers would get a healthy share of the tithe, or a even a chance to become god.\r\n\r\nThen one summer, it didn't rain once, and the lake was a dustbowl. In the middle just a sticky pool for the creatures to fight over. That was but the beginning. As the digging went on, the wells and creeks dried up too, and then crops began to fail. Still every month, comes the knock at the door, and all say it the same. \r\n\r\n\"Give us your tithe.\"     \r\n\r\n\"But there's not enough to meet the tithe,\"\r\n\r\n\"Then give us what you have.\"\r\n\r\nWe can try to hide some back, but the Godhands are always up in their ships looking down.

codex.d8b0c9e9a01b2c08ce89ff189821e428=Part of an article published in \"The Correspondent\" a left-wing Verduban news agency. A report on the agricultural college, north of Conos. The month of Qang, 2997. This translation filed away beside it in a dossier marked \"Investigate and Retaliate\".\n\nIn one class, Bandinian serfs were seen to crawl about the floor like pigs. When asked about this, a student joked that the college could not afford to use real livestock for practice, but that there was no exhausting the supply of Bandinians. \n\nOne senses that the ulterior motive of Economist Nalo's policy, is to condition the Pilipai into thinking that they are not at the bottom of the pecking order. By subjugating and demeaning Bandinians, they make the Pilipai students feel good about themselves. \n\nAsk any Saborian citizen about the Pilipai, and they will likely state that they are unenlightened mortals choosing to live the easy life. It is obvious to an outsider however, that the Pilipai are Saborian society. They are the potwashes, the farmers, the miners, and the cleaners. Then there are the shadier professions; prostitutes, assassins, spies - all are Pilipai.  \n\nIn short, the agricultural colleges are no longer used for teaching. There is a perimeter guard, and a high fence. There are rewards for conformity - the promise of farming equipment, or distribution of \"cushy\" farmland (such as olive or grape crops) - only demonstrating how the focus of such institutions is not education, but the streamlining of an underclass. \n\nIt is one of many responses to the growing unrest among elder Pilipai, that life has grown intolerably hard. They used to trade with the Bandini, but since the situation began in Darat, very few Bandini now have cause to come into Sabor, leaving the Pilipai to trade among themselves, and enjoying a lot less variety of produce. Put these things together, and Sabor appears a volcano that might erupt at any time.

Yet the arena was already a-thunder; white streaks in the sky, as if the gods had augured the occasion. From the gunwhale of the Hawk Royal, I could see the Saborians were more than ten thousand deep, ships emblazoned with their sinister winged motif. The Sky Hulks lurked between, though they dawdled as ponderously as our own.\n\nThere was little preamble. The front lines converged and splintered and many were sunk down to wreck on the peaks and in the valleys of the Korchis. We, being towards the front, were very soon in the action. The armory and weapon factory were our targets, and being of significance, were well-defended. \n\n\"Shall we advance?\" said the hand to Captain Astor. The steeple of his father's hawk helm glinted in the hazy sun, and without words, he motioned it was time. The officers smiled nervously as they saluted him, and forthwith we led our spearhead of ravagers in smokey charge.

Boarding being one of his specialties, he seemed destined to succeed. But the task, while on the face of it seeming so simple, became quickly devious. A horde of Essedari 'thrusters being surprised upon Lafite, to jet and bounce about his crewmen like angry bees. They meddled with the engines, and the controls, and The Ventyure was slowed to standing. \r\n\r\nSo elementary was the duck shoot thereafter, that The Ventyure was rapidly aflame, a pyre from which the bees scarpered, leaving our strategy undone. Lafite himself escaped. He had heavy shot in one leg, shrapnel all over, and burns rendering one arm without use.\r\n\r\nThe storm enveloped us, and none could see Foundation for the smoke and the tempest.

We would have turned back, but he had his orders, and he would see them through. It was a mark of our love for him that none of us gave further thought to turning back.\n\n\"Onward!\" came the cry, and the Hawk Royal spread her wings, climbing above her lease of hawklings. The eight smaller ships followed and we flew in synthesis over the deathly wound into which the ocean poured, to a place where the silvery line of the battlecloud was visible.\n\n\"That cloud is gargantuan,\" said the hand, \"Captain, we will not perforce see the enemy until the final moment.\"\n\n\"And they will not see us.\"\n\n\"But how will we know if we are even-matched?\"\n\n\"We are always even-matched,\" said Astor, \"get the forecannons polished, and bridge officers, get to the bridge and strap in.\"\n\nWhen we had crewed the hawk brood alongside the main fleet, we heard the great clamour as turrets rotated, and alarms sounded, and the knees and elbows of the Sky Hulks creaked.

codex.155b4d27bbc46ef961f6d9dcb80c1108=Foundation in the Dark Years - A Book Review of Aswand's Bandini Wars - The True Story, by Professor Lei Martovlin, University of Muskdog.  \n\nI'm going to be looking through Aswand's take on the Bandini Wars of 559-636. Let me preface by saying that I have the utmost respect for Aswand, both as a human being, and as a fellow citizen of Ten-Rui. I am also happy to acknowledge the great contribution her homeland of Gall has made to the advancement of science, and continue to marvel at how such a tiny island nation continues to excel despite its overwhelming lack of morals in regard to technology.\n\nI digress from my review of The Bandini Wars - The True Story in which I contend the scholarship of Aswand, who is an absolute disgrace to the very word University. To introduce myself, I am Lei Martovlin, Foundation's greatest living historian, in his ninetieth year, with no time left to mince words. \n\nHer book was a difficult read, actually no, a fiasco. In part because Aswand for some reason decides not to have the Gallish translated to Ishgiru by an expert, but attempts (and fails) to do it herself. Also, because she is scandalously presumptuous, lazy and demented, with no appreciation of factual evidence, or the merest understanding of context.
codex.b7d0109a99115dc4957542bd3fd597f2=Let me start with what we know about the causes of the war. Aswand haughtily announces that the Bandini under general Alkabar invaded Sabor for its fertility. I do not contend that this was something of a draw, but it was not the primary reason for the invasion of 559. The main motive was, of course, that Sabor was not a unified territory, but a collection of city-states. As such, by raiding just one or two cities, he and his men could easily take the spoils and return to Bandinia.  \r\n\r\nWhat they did not count on was the unification of Sabor by Epilomelos. Epilomelos played on existing harmony between the states of Sabor, and was able to lead a combined force to drive the Bandini back. Of course we know what followed - a staggering reprisal from Epilomelos' men. They took no prisoners, and the Yellow Blood River ran red. By 636, almost no Bandini menfolk remained, and millennia of servitude were etched into the wall.
codex.dc921a89bf9608f5b08ebc96a8369eb1=Many question the value of ancient history, but I draw your attention to current events. Look at the labour camps, are they not the legacy of Alkabar's arrogance? The lack of Saborian guilt carries over from that assault in antiquity, when the peace of central Amum was disrupted. This is not of course to excuse the actions of the present leaders of Sabor, or to gloss over the obvious hypocrisy at the heart of their system. Nor am I suggesting that the modern Bandini, characteristically apologetic, are in any way at fault for the actions of their predecessors. \r\n\r\nIn 559, the disparate cities of Sabor were taken by surprise, as the Bandini, led by Alkabar, crossed what is now known as the Yellow Blood river, through the Amum mountains via skeleton pass, and ravaged the Saborian desertlands. They burned villages, looted farms, and used captives as shields. Worst of all they set fire to, and gutted the city of Cherno, over which the modern settlement of Conos now sits. The terrifying assault was unprecedented and unexpected. Rumour has it that Epilomelos, a very small man, wobbled atop three wooden crates as he addressed an anxious crowd gathered at Momoros. He had invited diplomats from Redusa to witness the reaction of the crowd to his speech.
codex.4217fe1f91efd279332d8f871f95229b=Epilomelos' speech was one of togetherness and community. First and foremost, he argued that their land was hard to defend from outsiders, with its many subdivisions, borders, and isolated cities. Recent internal squabbles had not helped prepare against a large-scale invasion. He suggested that a combined \"Sabor\" could put an end to the Bandini threat, and do more still besides. The speech received an ovation, and the die was cast. \r\n\r\nEpilomelos was elected general of the armies of Sabor. He began by pincering the Bandini by unloading troops on the northern shore near the border, so as to get in behind the raiders. Soon after a massacre occurred. The Bandini surrendered, but it made no difference, as the Saborians killed all their prisoners. \r\n\r\nSabor's transformation from disparate cities to one nation was only just beginning. Epilomelos, by this time, was already determinedly idealistic. His rally to the Saborians was \"Why suffer like this, when we can prevent war, famine and chaos with togetherness?\" Epilomelos showed Sabor that it was possible to make something better, something pure.
codex.81b10d2272843823ed4f57285f3ab53a=Within six months, The Saborians had mobilised a large army, and stormed into Bandinia, though there was fierce fighting in the mountain passes, there were simply too many Saborians. Once they had reached Darat, they systematically executed any remaining males (for it was felt that the decision to raid Sabor was as a result of Bandinia's war-like and macho governance). A memorial was erected in Darat, a gigantic pillar, topped with a sculpture of a lamb and its shepherd (it has toppled in the 19th century) and was considered a universal symbol of peace, but also a symbol of submission. The Saborians wanted to portray themselves as shepherds to a wayward Bandini flock.
codex.88ef5066b7126f61ebe4baa923a60d29=The Saborians remained in power for 70 years, all the while insisting that Bandini children be schooled with a simplified variant of the Saborian model.\nIt is not clear why Sabor did not simply annexe or take ownership of the Bandini lands, but it is thought perhaps, that they saw no advantage in doing so. Bandinia was derelict and barren even before the war. Sabor was already too large a land to govern, and they would have been happy enough to see the Bandini more or less castrated. \n\nSome say the Saborians left because they were ashamed of what they had done, but there is no proof of that anywhere. Either way, in the year 636, Sabor withdrew their military to counteract internal threats, and never returned to Bandinia, a land that would never be the same again.\n\nTo summarise then, while Aswand makes a brave attempt at analysis, her book is a crying shame. Her view that Sabor unified because it was inevitable is a gross simplification she arrives at while ignoring the key figure Epilomelos. His oratory was demonstrably instrumental. His was an idealism that is still the bedrock of the cities of Redusa and Momoros to this day....\n\n<the text here was made wet and the ink has run and faded almost entirely>

I regret that I never once acknowledged him during the debate, though I knew beneath the swagger, he yearned to rekindle our family bond. I was too proud to tell him I felt the same. \r\n\r\nSoon after the contest, my fame spread, and I received an invitation to the court of the Empress.
codex.9699b1fc64c6a410e8b715aa3270a200=Twenty years ago he had me kidnapped. I found myself stranded here like the Empress Getta Renata in the old story. But unlike her, I never had a saviour to rescue me, nor have I wanted one. \r\n\r\nI no longer hold the petty ambitions and hopes of a young Warlock. Instead I crave the attunement with nature these islands confer upon me. I've learned to enjoy peace while I can, for I see that soon a great sadness will take us.\r\n\r\nI have looked to the past and augured the future, and it concerns my brother. As the priests of Melliflua say, \"destruction is the natural consequence of a heightened desire to preserve\". \r\n\r\nI have shared my mind with his, through the sibling bond that remains in spite of everything. He says humans are small and insignificant, and that their pride outweighs their value. He is ready to offer us up to the gathering folds of darkness, and I see no way to stop him.
codex.ff20f950225d5dbc6fff360a26025e6f=Oh what a joy it is to be young, the world opened up like sliced fresh fruit, but Grandma sits on the verandah, her mouth soured up like a lemon. Why does she have to be like that? \r\n\r\nDad said soldiers came here when she was small, when the family had no food to speak of. Now she spends the whole day eating and complaining it was better back then, and that men were real men and so on. I know she means to embarrass my man because he's a painter - as if there were no painters back then. I thinks she's just jealous I have a Mellifluan boyfriend.\r\n\r\nShe says it was better before Atlas. I say it couldn't have been, because there was war and everything else in Chabuti back then. They even called it \"the fall of Chabuti\", when the pirates held sway. Dad says we don't hear as much about the pirate king now, if he still exists. \r\n\r\nStill Grandma dirt-talks our neighbours, and closes off anything new or different. One moment she'll say the Saborians are perfect, the next she says they are mad, and insists that no-one bakes bread like they do here in Fasio. She lives on bread these days, but won't eat crab. She says it reminds her of her first husband, who was a crab-catcher. She says he always came home stinking of crab.
codex.b58a33ca7da85681dfaade4a9dc2f5b8=Scree.\r\n\r\nA rainstorm comes. My fur is soaked, and the other mice smile and play in the puddles. \r\n\r\nIn the reflections I see my bad leg. It reminds me that Greyfin is bound to him now. I am part of this curse.\r\n\r\nI slink into his chamber. He knows I am present, and reaches down to me to offer a dried grape from far Sabor. \r\n\r\nI have seen the result of his experiments, the worm-ridden welts and boils on his chest. I know that he suffers with himself, and yet we keep up our pretences. I am the highest of mice. He is the highest of men. I poison the mice to their business, he poisons the Empress to hers.\r\n\r\nHe whispers to me, \"How do I end this world?\"\r\n\r\nBut what of my conscience? This man saved me from the pipe that night when I might have died. I console him from his wickedness, show him gratitude with a twitch of my whiskers.\r\n\r\nSo, I ask my kin, \"What destroys everything?\" and when they are well-fed, they scurry into the streets to look for the answer.\r\n\r\nScree. Scree.
codex.c4b53013c474ae81c48d81ac94807732=<A Saborian edition of an introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>\nAbout Bandinia\nBandinia is an arid kingdom situated in the southwestern part of the continent Amum, otherwise dominated by Sabor. Bandinia itself is accessible via Sabor, although it is a one-way ticket. Once you cross over, you won't be able to renew your documents, and will have to make your way back home from Darat or Driss, where passenger flights are few and far between. Your best bet is to make your visit in the Month of Nuess, when there are many more frillships heading out of Bandinia on their way towards Koinos. \n\nUnlike Sabor, Bandinia has a system of currency much like our own. Bandinian coinage is distinctive in that each unit varies in size and quality. Unfortunately this leads to plenty of debate as to whether the coins in your hand are counterfeit. Most Bandinians will value the metal itself, even if they won't believe it a genuine coin. Add to this the fact that any given purchase can be haggled, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nAs a general rule, take 90% away from a price and work up from there. 50% of the asking price is as high as you should go when making a final offer. If you can get a few good deals like this, Bandinia is one of the most exciting places to shop in Foundation. Every part of Darat seems to harbour a secret trade. Metalworkers, Carpenters, Glassmakers, artisans of every type. You get the impression nothing has changed in thousands of years. You will notice quite a few Ishgiruan merchants here, looking for items to sell on at vastly inflated prices in Ten-Rui.
codex.4892808ebe543180398adf91219577f3=Generally tourism is good for Bandinia, though it does necessitate desperation in many. Too often you are led into traps, sometimes set by entire families, to make you part with your cash. Often children are used as a lure, to induce your pity or get your attention.\r\nYou can exchange currencies only at the bureaus in Darat, which will be the first thing you want to do. The rates are unreasonable, but worse, it is believed a lot of the money is diverted directly into the coffers of the corrupt royal family.\r\n\r\nAll-in-all Bandinia can be expensive, or very cheap, it's up to you to get the best value you can. At first the landscape may seem barren and unkind, one of craggy sheep hills and dusty mountain passes. But if you head to Driss in the south, a dune-like landscape unfurls, and where the ocean laps the shore, sumac and ocotillo grow. \r\n\r\nNavigating will require either a private skyship (which you can hire cheaply), or a guide and some mules (even cheaper). There are some interesting table-rock formations in the north west which jut upward above the dried-up river valleys. The old ports of the west coast are also a little-known delight, where stories abound of Bandini sailors trading with a mysterious sea-kingdom. They must be very mysterious indeed, since there is nothing west of Bandinia on any map I've ever seen.
codex.d7845f3f1353dc706c7fe508e0ae1081=Places to Stay \nIn the cities, the best places to stay are probably family homes. The ramshackle hotels cost five times more, or ten, in the case of the avoid-at-all-costs \"royal\" hotels. In the evening if you wait at the clocktower in Darat's central square, you can be sure a local will approach you. Remember to stick to the negotiation rules in the introduction to get the right price. \n\nBefore long you will likely find yourself dining on authentic Bandini cuisine, and even meeting some of your hosts' extended family. Bandini families are often huge, possibly a reaction to the genocide that followed the failed incursion into Sabor by the Bandinian General Alkabar.\n\nEating\nThe Waterguji market food is spectacular, the aromas of spices so readily used in Bandinian cuisine wafting throughout. Driss market isn't quite as big, but benefits from the coast, in that there is heaps of fresh seafood. Anything outside of the cities will be very rustic, and sometimes difficult to stomach. The East Bandinian fascination for eating monkey ears, for example, was one that was lost on me. The thing is, Bandinians do know taste, and for the most part, you should just trust your instincts, if something smells good, don't be afraid to try it. \n\nMy favourite dish is Ariai, a one-pot stew made with lamb, peas, mint and ogballs. It is a staple you will almost certainly encounter if staying in a family home.
codex.f5509abe2736a08ccdda16fd2f4bd9da=Entertainments\nThe Bandini are a hard-working people, but they are also the creators of Foundation's best-known sport, lallara, a ball game that takes place inside a small square court. The sport is an international hit, and there is even a Verduban team (The Icebreakers). The court areas of Darat is known as Lallaralata, and is among the most developed and affluent parts of the city. Sadly much of this is an illusion, since most money in Bandinia lines the pockets of the few. \n\nObviously the open markets of Darat are superb, but don't forget to make a stop at the palace of the three popels, gigantic shields made of brass which adorning its domed roof.   \nIn Driss, the Statues of Alacute, is a reminder that we should be very respectful of Bandinian History. These statues date from long before the Gallish calendar began. Estimates vary, but some say these are as much as 10,000 years old. They are sealed in behind a wooden wall, to prevent wind-erosion.\n\nFor horror-thrills, trek between shacks along Skeletal Pass in the Amum mountains, spending the night at each stop. It is rumoured that the skeletons after which the pass is named appear after midnight and recreate the battles that took place there when General Alkabar was finally driven back to Bandinia by the armies of Sabor.
codex.b3966daa1ccfb6c7a67ff6419336209a=Don't miss\nThe Bandini believe in a god for almost every aspect of life. Their gods are cruel and merciless, and think themselves superior to mortals, even though they'd make the worst mortals of all. Still, the Bandini celebrate them with a kind of fateful ambivalence, and nowhere is this more enthralling than along the banks of the Driss river, where a seemingly endless mural that travels through the city and up the estuary to the sea depicts the entire mythology of the gods. If you don't have time to see it from start to finish, arguably the best section appears just before the city limits on the way to the sea. I am told this chaotic and fiery design was inked as long ago as the 1200s, at a time when Bandinia had scarcely recovered from the Saborian genocide. It is preserved in a coating of resin once every twenty years.
codex.885552efa9e1ff252f6280211c8782a3=Watch Out For\nPenitents - Avoid the river bank in Darat, since the \"yellow-blood\" river is the haunt of a particularly despicable group of Bandinians. These are the yellow-blood penitents whose interpretation of Bandinian school teaching is taken to extremes. They self-flagellate, causing harm to themselves in the hope that it will one day ease the burden of guilt felt by Bandinians over their past. \nIt is worth noting that many Bandinians hold a similar, though more moderate view, since the Bandini school curriculum is still heavily vetted by Sabor. This is a peculiar arrangement, but one believed key to a lasting peace between the nations.\n\nLitter - Litter and detritus is everywhere in Bandinia, a problem not helped by the lack of infrastructure, and a general carelessness about personal hygiene. Wash your hands often, drink only fresh running water, or boiled water, and keep your feet well-covered.\n\nHeat - As you head out into the desert, always carry water with you, as while there are plenty of oases in the desert basins, you may find the water is toxic. Temperatures in direct sunlight can be unbearable, so take a good broad hat (like a Tarrery hat) if you are unfamiliar with it. \n\nIllness - It is common to pick up a bug when in Bandinia, and if you do, it is better to deal with it yourself since reports of medical care sound terrifying. But do not let any of that intimidate you into not making a trip. Bandinians are lovely, incredibly humble people, who are welcoming and kind.
codex.9fbd7ec45ffa7f5c955a6f67f456a5b2=<A Saborian edition of an introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>\nNorthern Sabor \nSabor is perhaps the most naturally beautiful and yet architecturally advanced of societies in the west. Nowhere is this more evident than in the northern cities of Agbana, Momoros and the capital Redusa. The difficulty is that tourism is only beginning to find its feet in Sabor, and you will find yourself chaperoned by a delegate as soon as you declare your foreign nationality.     \n\nThe Saborians themselves are a deeply optimistic and fortunate people. Your guide will be permanent for the duration of your stay (maximum two weeks if you wish to go landside, with no return within a year) and will have been assigned to you from a pool of tourist guides, so it's luck of the draw I'm afraid. \n\nI've been to Sabor twice, and on both occasions had excellent and knowledgeable guides who were quite relaxed about my questions and heading off the beaten track. I have heard stories of less welcoming visits, but I think they are few and far between. The success of the Saborians often incites jealousy, and many take any opportunity to discredit their system.
codex.16b88e885783563b132f04d709722353=Fees\nPolitics aside, heading into Sabor proper will come at significant personal cost. To even get in you will need to be able to donate a significant sum in luxury materials (there is a list available at Muskdog skyport). This will determine the length of your stay, up to a maximum of two weeks. I paid six kilograms of Tungsten, setting me back 800VN at the time of writing. Guests are welcome in Sabor, but you must play by the rules, or suffer the consequences (See the section on Southern Sabor for information about \"ditching\", an illegal activity which is not at all recommended.)\n\nOne break that you may not have foreseen, is that paying your fees entitles you to free travel, food and accommodation, chosen by you. Although the fee itself still makes a trip to Sabor more expensive than most holidays, it is made more reasonable by the knowledge that you won't need to open up your purse on the other side. Don't expect all you can eat though. Portion sizes are controlled to the weight of a feather, and over-eating is considered a grave offence, which could see you sent packing. Travel is also quite limited, though your guide will endeavour to make arrangements at your request.
codex.e06cea4746511e903045469a9580f0f2=Places to Stay \nAccommodation in Sabor being free, you are entitled to stay at any of the purpose-built travel hotels around the central hubs of Redusa and Momoros, or along the ocean view swoosh at Agbana. A Saborian will no doubt tell you that no single hotel is objectively better than another, since they are all furnished identically. Of course, in reality there are many reasons not to pick one at random. In Redusa, Vitellus' Hotel is very popular as it is nearest to both the steeple gardens and Molin's Restaurant (see Entertainments) and its owner seems to take a great more care in his business than others, for example in some hotels you will see signs up for most of the day saying \"Out at the cloistrum, back in 20 minutes\". The simple truth is, a lot of Saborians don't enjoy the jobs they have been given, and will do the absolute bare minimum. Although reporting bad practice might seem helpful, your guide (who will stay in the same hotel as you) should take care of that for you. Criticism of any kind may land you in hot water. These are gods, remember!
codex.9046abc4dd6ac2a62f368f01e05ae9c0=Eating\nSaborian street vendors are generally worth stopping at. Pilipai attend the stalls, but they are managed by citizens. Produce is always fresh, and your guide will extol the abundant Tava fruit, which Saborians believe very important to maintaining good physique. To my taste it has a strangely savoury note, but it does seem to be doing their health some good - you will find it hard not to gawp at the beauty of the Saborian citizens, whose skin shines, whose muscles ripple, whose hair is rich and dark. The Saborians spend a huge amount of time outside in the sun, and are always game for sport before mealtimes, or a good walk after. Obviously the standout cookery can be found at Molin's Cafe. I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Gugustus Molin on my last visit, a charming man in every regard. He is only young, but taking the culinary circles of Sabor by storm. You eat very well at Molin's, though it is so popular now that your guide may be unable to make a reservation. If you are lucky enough to get in however, you will find a range of dishes from all over Foundation - the set menu taking up an entire day's food stamp (so choose wisely). Regardless, it is an absolute privilege to eat there. 
codex.80b4d81dc58fb273e84f710acf603110=Entertainments\nJust walking around the centre of Redusa could take up the whole of your two week stay. Obviously the Stalk building is a must-see, being a miracle of design inside and out. You'll be shown to the viewing platform, which is about 435m from ground level. Above that is the Committee and assembly rooms, all contained in the iconic mushroom disc.\n\nMomoros and Redusa have the river delta, and some magnificent gardens. Agbana has a bright and shimmering seafront, with (aquatic) ferries that can take you to the offshore islands. Tonking tournaments are frequent in all three cities - a sport with sticks and glass. There is a well-tended Zoo at Momoros home to the many curious plants and animals of the Mount of Plenty, and in Redusa, the History of Sabor museum is fascinating if a little partisan (Warning it has no language cards).\n\nYour guide will take you to the local cloistrum on a daily basis. If you don't want to be embarrassed, stay clear of the Boros pool (see page 84), and get a back scrub by the excellent masseuses of the Depurgum instead. You are also welcome to attempt to scale the Apotheon, for the simple reason that it causes the Saborians great pleasure to see foreigners fail at it even more horrifically than they themselves do. It really does take a lifetime to master.
codex.37582ea5f9f1a011dfa7ad2c2ea6f054=Don't Miss\nThe Redusa University is extremely old, dating from 1186. Situated in the Pilipai town, which you will need to take an elevator to access, the University is a vast splendid building, and still a functional one. The crenellations on its upper stretch of wall are typical of the \"crescent\" period, during which friezes and murals of everyday life were particularly popular. Many of these depict the god-king Epilomelos and symbolic representations of various city-states that united in the 1st millennium. \n\nDue to the lack of uptake in learning above academy level, the University is an empty part of town, perfect for a bit of quiet time.
codex.376eaa6d2d453044a58245cfc8bad060=Watch Out For\n\nHeat - Though you may be tempted to stay outside by the water's edge all day, the temperatures this near to the equator can be dangerous. Always drink plenty of water, and carry a sunshade if you have fair skin.  \n\nAgeism - If you are clearly over the age of fifty, you may notice a difference in the way you are treated. Since you are not a god, it won't prevent you from visiting, but your guide won't let you enter the Cloistra, and you might find you are treated like a second-class citizen. If you are a Saborian-speaker, you might overhear mutterings such as \"no-one's going to clean up after you here.\" This perception is so prevalent among Saborians that even the Pilipai of the city are individually selected to be young and attractive. \n\nThere is almost no crime in Northern Sabor, which is remarkable. There are however, many pitfalls of etiquette that may land you a night in the cells. Do not ask questions about politics, and above all, do not mention rumours of relations between citizens and Pilipai. This is a deep source of shame for Saborians, and may hit a nerve.
codex.bbd3c886bac92935378fa404ebdaf520=<A Saborian edition of an introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>\r\nSouthern Sabor and the Studded Desert\r\nThe south of Sabor is home to only one large city - the sprawling Conos. The name Conos is believed to have been derived from the ancient \"Koinos\", the southern continent from which all humans came. The city itself is a fiercely hot, but otherwise upholds the modern living of its northern counterparts. \r\n\r\nThe people of Conos tend to be a good bit more laid-back than the itinerant northerners, but the flipside to this, is that they seem to be more bigoted, and are quick to distrust outsiders. Look no further than their relations with the Bandini, who even in these happy times are used as cusswords. \r\n\r\nThe Pilipai seem particularly underprivileged in the south, and although my guide in the region made a point of heading to the Pilipai club, on the outskirts of Conos, a place for hard-working farmers and miners to relax, I wasn't convinced. Especially when I insisted we visit the Studded Desert (see places to stay) and I saw a group of nomadic Pilipai known as \"wastrels\" collecting and chiselling gemstones in very basic conditions. \"They're happy enough,\" was all my guide would say on the subject. \r\n\r\nIn the city though, there are some wonderful moments. The Apocali Gardens are mesmerising (see Entertainments) and the Saborians certainly know how to have good clean fun. Beyond Conos, there is wilderness in every direction, with the Mount of Plenty being a memorable three-day excursion.
codex.1b5215423e733ea5d3d78b956411a6e3=Places to Stay \nAs with the north, accommodation is free, and there is nothing shabby about the hotels in Conos. They have a different vibe to them than the ones in the north. Roomier, with great big fans to keep them cool. You will seldom find hoteliers at their desks however, as it is widely accepted that Conos citizens are the laziest workers of all Saborians. You might find your hotelier lounging on a terrace, or down at the Cloistrum. The music nights in summer at the Turgus Hotel are captivating, though you don't have to stay there to enjoy them.\n\nIf you want to stay in the wilderness, you are entirely in the hands of your guide, who will often know a Pilipus well enough to organise a night's stay. I once stayed in a wonderful seaside resort at Gratta (where Saborians citizens go to relax in mid-summer) where the Pilipai grilled fish on open fires, and the swimming and boating was fabulous. The trouble is, it can be quite hard to steer your guide, as the towns outside Conos are small and frequent, and have little understanding of fun.
codex.d2d9169e1657a95225ccb0b56a664b8b=Eating\r\nA delicious speciality of Conos is a savoury pastry called \"Mallum\". Mallums are conical and have a range of fillings. Sour cheese and the dark Mallum leaf from which the snack takes its name is the traditional and most common one. If you can make a trip to the Mount of Plenty, you will find fish and berries and much else besides. A good guide can make the hike up to the mount one of the trips of a lifetime if he knows how to forage. Some guides are better than others, so think twice before eating anything you are given.\r\n\r\nEntertainments\r\nThe Apocali Gardens in Conos contain every known species of plant in Sabor. Particularly exciting is the \"Danger Zone\", a living museum of some of the weirdest and deadliest plants in Foundation. On entry you are given a set of long rubber gloves, and an eyemask! Like many museums, it was recently opened up to Pilipai, Citizens and visitors alike. Therefore expect a good crowd.\r\n\r\nDancing is extremely popular here, including the salacious belly-shuffles of ancient times. Do not be fooled, the dancers may be looked at, but it is deeply ungodly to even approach one of them. There are dance halls everywhere, and you will be encouraged to participate in some of the other dance styles such as Mestallus, a sedate and sensitive dance that requires a rhythm in three-time.\r\n\r\nMost of the other entertainment on offer in southern Sabor relates to trekking and exploring the desert wilderness. There are specialist citizens designated for this exact purpose, so expect to wave goodbye to your city guide. In reality, exploring is not as free as it sounds. The guides stick to set paths, and will almost certainly refuse to deviate from them.
codex.f2f8f0dceec3eb7e552733f46944abdd=Don't Miss\nThe Studded Desert - many have been taken in by this breathtaking sight, a glittering carpet of gemstones buried in dirt. What caused its formation is unclear, but its place in Saborian life and legend is massive. It provides the seemingly endless source of mineral resources (although strangely little Atlas) upon which the four cities thrive. \n\nThe largest town in the desert is Jejuna, perhaps home to a thousand gem scratchers. It has water, but that's about it. Expect to be well-prepared, and your guide to baulk at the idea of heading into the desert, since Citizens never wish to be too far from the city.
codex.e7d1d92248193d8cc4ed386d9e8d76a9=Watch Out For\nBe careful if you do enter the wilder parts of South Sabor. There are wildcats everywhere, the Fear Cat being twice your size, and partial to the taste of human flesh. There are special perils in the Mount of Plenty region, including the Siren plant that reacts to contact with the skin by giving off a chemical alerting all of its species to your presence. The Sirens will all then simultaneously expand to five times their size, attempting to corral you. An experienced guide will often keep a long knife for just such situations.\n\nDitching - As was noted in the section on Northern Sabor, entering the country is expensive, restrictive and brief. Some travellers choose to circumvent this by \"ditching\". I.e. landing skyships unauthorised in empty parts of Sabor in the name of adventure. Apart from the fact that you are committing a crime (punishable by death in the worst cases) you will find it extremely hard, even in the laid-back south, to avoid questions about your identity. The little book of entitlements not being in your possession will put even a Pilipus on alert, and with the rewards, make them likely to report you to the authorities. \n\nBandinians - You will notice there are quite a few Bandinians in this region, although not in Conos itself. They are immediately recognisable by their shabby dress, and the men by their long moustaches. They are the only non-Saborian nationality with free passage, and are left unsupervised and unrestricted in their travel around Sabor. There are several reasons for this, according to Thaumenon, one of my guides in Bandinia. One he says, was that Bandini used to get past the border control or ditch so often, that it was tiresome for the Saborians to regulate. Two, the Bandini are so afraid of the Saborians, that they generally don't stay for long. Three, they provide a valuable exchange of goods with the Pilipai when travelling around. Bandinians travelling in Sabor are often dangerous to non-Saborians, as they will think you an easy target for crime.
codex.d7aca81272b72c80f7c0c10ead891bd6=<An introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>\r\nCentral Karem\r\n\r\nOnce you're out of the bustle of Karem city, and follow the river Kar up to its source in central Karem, you may find it easier to navigate on horseback. There are few convenient places to land a skyship due to the rugged and mountainous terrain, and the beautiful orange, yellow of the autumn forests that cover it. As the land grows ever more hilly towards the border with Pin, some hostelries in the city of Putty may tout \"views of the Pintins\", but this is geographically impossible. The reality is that these views are of the slopes of southern Pin, where the vast Pintin range has barely begun.\r\n\r\nThe people of central Karem seem rather grim at first, but after a good few hours smalltalk, ideally over a drink or two, you can really see what makes them tick. Chiefly it's a love of the wilderness. Their ardent survivalism we may easily misinterpret as heartlessness, but these are real people used to a few hard knocks. \r\n\r\nThe cities of Putty, Qahvzin and Albodan are all in this region, producing massive amounts of wood. They are useful for supplies and general commodities, but little else. You'll find most Karem live by their own means, which doesn't mean they aren't generous, but they'll expect you to have some knowhow if you accompany them out in the forest.
codex.ff845ffa0717cd441e4530605653a84d=Places to stay \nGenerally accommodation in Karem is rudimentary, so you'll need to take your own alternative. That said, there are some excellent hill-shacks offering beds, hearty meals and stables. The white-dappled conical shacks are the most showy, but that's because they're the best, and if inside they're brimming with locals, you know you're in for a good time.\n\nIf you are in south central Karem, you may find it interesting to head to the town of Oppeetobee, and join a circle of warlocks for the evening. They usually have a free bed. While these local Warlocks may lack the renown sufficient to receive invitation to the court of the Empress, in many ways they represent truer Karem living and philosophy, and seem to have a genuine affinity to nature. They often take visitors foraging for food and for medicine if that's something you fancy. You may be asked to do some unusual things over the course of your stay, but that's more cause for celebration than alarm, and you may even get to have your future foretold. \n\nEating\nUsually if you can find somewhere to stay, they will feed you. The cuisine of Oppeetobee is great, though the predilection for offal in these parts is not for the faint-of-heart. No bit of the animal goes unused. Most commonly you'll find these dishes served with beans and ogballs, and occasionally some pine sap and and green pine tips.
codex.393f02d62b9d44d3f4e67a66d12438ef=Entertainments\nTinkers wandering the region sell all kinds of curiosities. Many of these are actually used in ritual practice by the Warlocks (rabbit tail, raccoon liver) but you may find they suggest using natural ingredients as remedies for all kinds of conditions. \n\nThe warlocks are a sight to behold at debate, particularly when the chalk circles are full. There is usually a healthy rivalry between them as they try to assert authority over one another, in the hope of rising up the food chain. \n\nWhile brutal, no one can deny that duelling is exhilarating. Sometimes ceremonial, other times violent, it is deeply rooted in Karem life. If you do visit Albodan, you could visit the Grunee Brothers' workshop. The geriatric twins are quite happy to show you around, as long as you leave any opinion on the propriety of weapons at the door. These men are passionate craftsmen, and claim that what people do with the weapons they buy isn't a matter for them to be concerned with.
codex.4663c32d5564d2a1fea0efbbea733c28=Don't Miss\nNaturally there are some magnificent treks through the Karem mountains, and particularly around the River Kar heading inland. Taking a guide is a good idea, though you may find they don't have a lot to say. There's climbing to be done here too, although the region has a mixed safety record, so make sure you have a reputable instructor and good equipment. \n\nWatch Out For\nUnfortunately there is only one resolution to a quarrel in these parts, and that is duelling. This may be the conclusion of even the most trivial disagreement, so my advice is, do not make yourself difficult company. \n\nPerhaps worse than this, is the recent spate of robberies, particularly on the alpine pass that crosses the border into Pin. The robbers are treefolk, who dwell in the large trunks of the Widder Tree, and will often ambush you from high above. If you do go this way, be sure to go armed yourself. It might even be better to avoid the road entirely if you feel confident enough to head across country.
codex.82584d754141e24f53f3f90eb9d550ff=<An introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>\nIshgiru East\n\nEastern Ishgiru is characterised by its unspoiled green valleys and gorges, with the odd grand lake. For travellers, the magnificent ruins of the old Kingdom at Wellah are surely the highlight. These toppled granite monuments mark the site of a great and ancient city where the Empresses once ruled. It is believed that some time in the first millennium, the course of the river Ish that ran from the fertile plains to the south coast became diverted, and that Ishgiruans were forced to become nomads. This early setback now seems part of their national psyche - an acceptance of the need to keep moving on. You will find Ishgiruans are typically impatient and have no time for fools, they like to do business fast and quick, and know how to make best use of their time.\n\nMost of the ancient Ishgiruans went west, gathering at the spit of land now known better as the port city of Ten-Rui. This is the modern seat of both Empress and Kioki Unity, and the largest city in Foundation. But some of those migrants did go East, and took instead to a number of smaller settlements, many of which still exist today. The largest of these is the city of Gondola, which meets the great ocean at Ishgiru's easternmost tip.  \n\nYou can change currency in Ten-Rui, to date, one Ishgiruan Spirit was worth four VN.
codex.db56f1bb65468a1ee653ea94724fac6f=Places to Stay\nBetween the small town of Gondola on the west coast, and the ruins at Wellah, are countless small villages at which to spend the night, each pretty much the same as the last. They are only interested in your money, so if you are hoping for anything more than a key to your room, and (hopefully) hot dinner once the money has left your hands, think again. The good news is, you can often haggle prices right down to below half of the original offer. The difference between the relative value of one gold Spirit here and in Ten-Rui is extraordinary.\n\nYou will find most Ishgiruans are a little more relaxed the further away from the ruins of the old kingdom you are. If however, you are looking for somewhere to stay in that area, which has boomed in recent years, you might expect to part with a good amount of money. My advice is that the knock-off hostelries are just so terrifying, it's not worth paying less. \n\nBy the time you reach sleepy and windswept Gondola, you will be delighted to find there are a hundred equally glorious family-owned hotels dotted along the seafront overlooking the great ocean. All of them deliriously relaxed and welcoming. You can land your skyship anywhere on the beautiful beaches, provided you don't leave any rubbish behind.
codex.b59b450d1a50e789720f903d98d3742c=Eating\nThere are so many good things to eat in eastern Ishgiru that I find it hard to know where to start. But street and casual food stalls are where you will get best value. Also, unlike my experience of Bandinian travel (see my guide to Bandinia), you probably won't be dragged off to someone's family home and cornered into paying for home cooking. I have divided appreciation of East Ishgiru food into coastal and inland.\n\nCoastal Ishgiru\nIn Gondola and south Ishgiru, fresh fish is the best thing to be had. The ocean is quite warm and filled with fantastic small fish. They are usually fried in a small amount of bean flour and served with baked root vegetables. Crab is not indigenous here however, so if you see it on the menu, do yourself a favour and choose something else.\n\nInland Ishgiru\nFlatbreads baked in stone ovens are my favourite memory of the region. They are often filled with a bean paste that is the staple of eastern Ishgiru. There is a spicy sauce often served with it that must be treated with caution. While it has a beautiful smokiness, it can also feel like the roof of your mouth is being peeled away. \nUnlike in Ten-Rui, and Karem over the border, there is very little in the way of meat eaten here, though some mutton is cooked during the cooler months.
codex.bac353dc78d366314c0fdfae33736fcb=Entertainments\r\nIf you have a heavy wallet, and enjoy a wager or two, the Splutter bird racing in the south-east desert towns is a hoot. Gondola also has a lallara team, and although at the time of writing they weren't doing too well, there's always a chance of a turnaround!\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for fine dining, but you may find some of the outdoor eating and live music to your taste. Unlike Ten-Rui, whose scene is dominated by the prevalence of the Gallish Pati-Pikk, the eastern Ishgiruans prefer the woodwind \"Gubba\" scene. \"Gubba\" is a fast style, that encourages very frenetic dancing! There is usually a weekly event during the night between the months of Babbo and Nuess in most towns, where locals grill fish and vegetables and the children play games. Night time is your best chance to see real life, because most Ishgiruans sleep during the day.\r\n\r\nDespite the cost, and if I recommend nothing else, a visit the ruins of the old city of Wellah and its palaces is essential. They are extremely well-maintained, largely because their restoration is a project close to local hearts. There was even a cult based around the \"True Empress\" established here - a group splintering away from support for the Empress in Ten-Rui - but it is generally bad form to mention it (see watch out for).  There is a small museum near Ish, where the site is located, including a perfectly preserved copy of the Book of Soil.\r\n\r\nThe beaches and water along the east coast are unspoiled, lovely and warm, and though the wind is often very strong here, you will likely find this a relief from the continental heat of inland Ishgiru.
codex.3178b80c79ba84eb1b5fcd909be2ac99=Don't Miss\nNights in the valleys under the stars with local music, and stories of the distant past. If you are inclined to head slightly further north, you may come across the Selenists - an ancient and isolated tribe, whose every action is defined by the movement of the two moons.\n\nWatch Out For\nIshgiruans do drink, but in moderation. If you decide to try some local brew, make sure you behave nicely, or you may have to pay a hefty fine to the mercantile authority for disturbing the peace. In some cases, travellers have received fines only for being foreign and having bought a drink, so watch out!\n \nThe safest thing to do is to never mention the Empress at all. You will probably overhear loud conversations in Ishgiruan (unlike multicultural Ten-Rui, there are few resident foreigners in the Gondola region) about the Empress' court. If you listen carefully, you will notice that they focus upon everyone but the Empress herself. In particular they will mistrust and question the attitude and actions of whichever Warlock currently holds office. The Empress however, is considered untouchable, regardless of any blame she might take for her politics. She is a deity of sorts, with an unbroken bloodline dating all the way back to before anyone can record.\n\nTry to buy things from locals, not from Ten-Rui traders who spend high season here, and  overcharge for basic things like animal bone necklaces. Musical instruments seem particularly to be a problem. If you do pick up an instrument memento, make sure you play it first and it works before handing over your money!
codex.442d9ea1e95471e9c094818d283a436e=<An introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>\nNorthwest Pin & The Pintins\n\nThere is really only one significant conurbation in all of Pin, and it is situated in the northwest, two days from where the Pintins meet the sea. Huacanado (translated as \"first peak\") is the highest city in the world. It even has a specially constructed platform on which skyships may land, though this can become very busy during festival time. The city itself is full of colour - brightly-painted buildings, and costumes with a similar dazzle. \n\nThe Pin can seem quite retiring folk at first, but their pizazz comes out on festival days. They are truly some of the most affable peoples in Foundation. This friendliness belies a certain fatalism. For example, \"whatever happens, happens,\" is a phrase you will regularly hear thrown into conversation. But like anywhere else, disagreements do arise. Pistol duels, as in Karem to the south, are common. The difference here being that there is rather a lot more ceremony, than there is danger. Special protective gowns are embroidered from long-neck wool for duellists, so that there is a good chance of surviving a shot, but it still be clear who the victor is. On the rare occasion that the winner is not obvious, it is not unheard of for fights to mutate into wrestling matches. \n\nIn general, you will find the Pin to be generous, naively enthusiastic about almost anything, and much like the Great Marshas far to their east, in that they are as happy to listen to the stories of others as to tell their own.
codex.ca2ce2753595b59f266558bc4221581a=Places To Stay\nStaying in one of the many shell-shaped hotels around the city is a jolly way to experience Pin life. Researchers at Panyana have recently suggested the desire to hear the sea is embedded within us all. Being so high up, the Pin began building the shell buildings to recapture that feeling because they missed it so much. The juxtaposition of the sound of the waves, and a view over a mountain town, is one to be found nowhere else.\n\nFurther inland, the mountains explode. The highest peak, Tito Bipo (translates as \"sweet grace\") is twice as high as the city of Huacanado, and has never been properly climbed. Nevertheless the Pinnish flag, horizontal stripes of orange and yellow, was recently lowered onto the peak. If you happen to be passing by (and have carefully checked the weather, which can be treacherous at that altitude) there are one or two flatter slopes towards the summit, on which a skyship can neatly fit. \n\nAt the very foot of Tito Bipo is the small city of Marimbi, where red and yellow pennants light up the path to the mountain shrine. Although almost perpetually in shadow, and half a league shy of the peak, they still promise incredible views. You will inevitably be offered a space in one of the elder tents for the evening, as they'll really love having you there. It's usually a bed that has never been used, as if saved especially for your visit.
codex.fb77181be19be033df149e441e0e89b3=Eating\nLong-neck milk is the Pinnish drink of choice. They do also produce soft cheese from it, although it's not for everyone. It's usually served in a pool of melted butter. These sorts of comforting dishes help keep out the cold, which in the Pintin mountain range is extreme. \n\nYou are also probably risking an upset stomach if you try the fish up here, although you will see it being sold everywhere. Every few days a vast skytrawler hauls a catch back up to Huacanado, and the fish are either sold \"fresh\", or dried. \nThe dried ones smell foul, but are pretty reliable and tasty. The \"fresh\" ones are simply not worth the tummy trouble.
codex.d0aac870a39ee61aeefa4a61cec5c068=Entertainments\nFor views of the mountains, take the funicular up to Formini Glaz - \"eagle's reach,\" Where the whole continent forms an apron to the south. To the north are the Night Lands, and to the north-east, Tarrery. \n\nThe time to visit Pin is during one of the many festivals. Perhaps best-known is the Goatbear festival, during which children are encouraged to make effigies of themselves to sacrifice to the Goatbear, a beast (mythical or legendary depending on who you ask) of the mountain forests of southern Pin. Outsiders are welcome to participate in helping the children get their effigies up to scratch - prizes are given for those most closely approximating their owner. \n\nOther festivals include the well-known \"rejection of the letter from the Empress of Ishgiru\" festival, and an informal and an illegal firework day on which a year's supply of fireworks from Gall are set off at once. The firework festival is wild, dangerous and fantastic. Do bear in mind, if you are seen to be setting off fireworks, the Elders of Pin have the legal right to flog you (due to the number of avalanches the festival causes).\n\nDon't Miss\nMountain views. Seashell hotels. Long-neck butter, and long-neck fur coats and hats. (The plushest hats are the ones favoured by the Warlocks of Karem.)\n\nWatch Out For\nBad fish, out-of-control fireworks, goatbears.

But at that moment we were caught in heavy crossfire, and when the smoke cleared we found ourselves drifting towards the wastes of the Wahsili. I tugged at the lever, but found it to be stuck in full ahead, and that there was nothing we could do. I went below deck and scoured the hold. There was enough water and fuel, for a time.\r\n\r\nI speak Saborian, which is lucky, because he spoke no Ishgiru. His name was Herateum, and all he wanted was for me to end his misery. He asked me outright, and I said no. Then he said I had to do it because he couldn't feel below the knees. I'd tended to his wounds, and knew at once he was lying because he barely had a scratch on him.\r\n\r\nI fed him water and encouraged him to talk instead. To him this amounted to torture, and he started kicking and struggling and cursing, and I began to think it was a mistake keeping him alive. He was convinced it was an interrogation.\r\n\r\n\"Look around you,\" I said, \"what can you tell me I don't already know?\"
codex.d13d6879a6f5222956cc3dc9824d2907=I continued my survey of the ship, trying to work out how we could navigate the desert, and after Melliflua, what was left. Frankly I could have used his help, since his knowledge of deserts was likely superior to mine, but all the while Herateum kept saying;\r\n\"Do it. I must reach the rising place.\" \r\nSo in the end I said, \"Is this really how a god behaves?\"\r\n\"I'm not a god, I merely strive to be one,\" he snapped back, \"life is a test, and I have failed it.\"\r\nThen he cried like a little boy. I touched his hand, and he didn't recoil. I said, \"if you have failed, then I have failed. This isn't our war, it belongs to no-one. We were put here, we didn't ask for it.\"\r\n\"I must do what I can for Sabor. For the others. Only that would have seen me ascend.\"\r\n\"Let that all go,\" I said.\r\nHe was looking about him, at the bodies of the others. I reached deeper. \r\n\"You survived, but no-one else did. Don't you count yourself lucky? Don't you think there is a reason you were spared?\"\r\n\"What a selfish thing to think!\" he bellowed, \"I could have joined them in the Aetherium. I have no reason to go on being here.\"\r\nI sunk down next to him. \r\n\"You don't know that.\"\r\n\"I do.\" \r\n\"I don't think any of us do,\" I said. He had no answer, but was still brooding. For a moment I thought he might try to attack me, so I readied myself for a tussle. As it was, we sat there exhausted, watching the sunset.
codex.b1fe5423941b193051167f8352430467=\"Do you think limbo is coming, Tarik of Selene?\" said Herateum at long last.\r\n\"That's a Mellifluan story!\" I said, thinking he had confused my origins, but he hadn't.\r\n\"I know, but I thought you might believe it. Things are changing, in the ground, in the air. The birds don't sing as sweet.\"\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" I said, for once receptive to his heavy brand of sarcasm. I thought of the hole we saw below us back there, and of the plight of the low-town in Ten-Rui. \r\n\"My mother does not know. She does not know! She's never seen war, she doesn't know what war means.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" I sighed, brushing away my hair. \"How my Empress too, must find it hard to understand. Yet she must weigh the value of the conflict against the lives lost.\" \r\n\r\nI do not know if we can survive, but I am beginning to see humanity in Herateum. I see it through his divine veil.

codex.080f7e3c642458fcddfa22d7e7053210=Once there was a young Tarrery boy, and he loved and he gave, and by the wolf above us, he was brave. When he was offered food he took it. From birth his legs would not work, and when it was clear he would never be able to feed himself, his father cast him out into the cold to die. His mother loved him, and wanted to keep him, but she was loyal to his father. The young Tarrery boy could do nothing but wait for the cold of night to swallow him. \r\n\r\nIn the thin green sky, the boy saw the crags of the high Pintins. He dreamt of the night lands beyond, and their warm mud. He edged his legs across the snow towards it, no hope left, but taking comfort where he could. \r\nThen he saw Imhorta, her mouth opening, and he remembered the stories. He grew angry, and cried to the wolf, \r\n\"You cannot take me. I have given, I have loved and I have not hesitated to accept gifts of food!\" and Imhorta nuzzled her fur and replied,\r\n\"I have watched you, and know you tell the truth. I can find no weakness in you, but the legs with which you were born,\" and the boy said, \r\n\"But what other weakness matters? My family hate me, they have cast me out, and now death approaches.\"\r\n\"I will bear your burden,\" said Imhorta.

I would love to be taught!\" said the boy.\nThe wolf wrestled with the boy every day, until he was much stronger. They went hunting for food together, the boy upon Imhorta's back. Then the boy found wood, and fixed it to his legs so that he could cross the snow.

I kept telling myself I needed to get something sent, and a little voice kept saying, \"write later, it's too hard just now\".\n\nAnyway, this is my reply. I won't try and answer those questions you asked, because you asked them a long time ago, and they seem trivial now. Suffice to say, I'm living a happy life. I have a young son. Having him made me want to write to you, I don't know why.\n\nYou never said it, but I get the feeling reading over your letter again, that you felt terribly scared. You talked about wardens as if they were old friends, \ntaking comfort where you could. Am I right? \n\nI sometimes dream of you, standing at the foot of my bed, or a chance meeting at the Cloistrum. You say \"they let me out early,\" or something like that, and I worry that you are going to kill me. You are always angry in the dream, because I never wrote to you. \n\nI'd like to know how you feel now, ten years on? I understand if you don't want to reply. \n\nDiira.

It is the itch I had to scratch, the reason I was locked away -  I wanted to puncture that perfection.\n\nI have spent a lot of time reading, much as I did before the killings. Through reading, I have better understood myself. I know that my place is here, in a minimal and confined space. In my early life I was searching for that confinement without realising it. Even now, I would have difficulty living outside. I would feel the persistent need to transgress, much as I did on that day.    \n\nI have regrets of course.

No matter how good life can be, your existence alone undercuts it. You spoiled things, and I feel as much a god as a tiny beetle. \r\n\r\nBut something about it seems very unfair.

We've sold a lot of our plans in the last few months, it's been amazing.\n \nCSJ: Are you going to stand for Archdean?\n\nAD: Oh no!

codex.29b24b0ec00f0f7aa57cefc99e2e68e7=Jian Fondly - Speech to SAMVEG (Society Against the Misuse of Vegetables)\r\n\r\n\"Don't misuse vegetables - something I always say to young people whenever I meet them. The work you are doing is really important, and it's an absolute pleasure to be here. \r\n\r\nFirst of all I'd like to thank the CSSC for all their hard work in darning this eyepatch. I'll wear it with pride and feel your blessing as I learn to move on from that regrettable incident, when I lost my eye to a cucumber. \r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to talk about today, is a matter close to my heart. It's about a cause I've always wanted to take up - the plight of the Pilipai in Momoros - and losing my eye to a cucumber has only helped spur me on. \r\n\r\nThe trouble is, I think I've got off on the wrong foot with them. Visiting the Pilipai communities around Momoros and Redusa, I couldn't help but notice their staunch resistance to outsiders. \r\n\r\nMy intention was to find a local woman by the name of Elene, who had influence among her people. I remember the abuse I got from the locals as I made my way through the settlement - calling me foreign scum, dog-breath, and other names. One boy of about eight, threw a ripe tomato, which hit me square in the forehead.
codex.91e7b37743b92f41a6144d2b3ebc3e81=Starting to doubt whether the cause was worth taking up, I took heart that I was still alive, and that these Pilipai probably didn't know the extent of their own oppression. They had been brainwashed, and it was up to me to break the ice, Ice god forgive me.\r\n\r\nElene herself was having a bath when I arrived. She seemed horrified that I'd walked in, and I, anticipating she must be experiencing some shame regarding her body, told her that I did not object to seeing her in the nude, and that on the contrary she had a fine and full figure. \r\n\r\nHer husband, who was also present, seemed to disagree. The Pilipai dialect is somewhat rough around the edges, and I couldn't make out what was being said, but it seemed clear I had violated the laws of his household in some way when the man took the hot iron from his fire, and simulated an act he desired to perform upon me with it. \r\n\r\nSo the visit was a failure, I'll admit. But I have now made contact with the PPL (Pilipai Protection League) and aim to extend further peace offerings to the Pilipai, in the hope of improving their prospects. With your support, and the support of the PPL, I'm sure we can get back on track. \r\n\r\nSAMVEG Thank you for time, you've been wonderful.
codex.b1eaa9aa3696901caad6a186203ad9d0=I wanted to write a separate personal note to include with my academic papers, which I am told can be quite plain in style. My tutor says I might be better understood this way, should my research outlive me.\r\n\r\nI enjoy investigating the lifespan of Great Marsha swamp fauna. I feel I have a personal connection with the people of this remote region and had the good fortune to stay with a family there, and to witness their love of nature firsthand.\r\n\r\nThat the Marshas' habitat remains undisturbed, better allows us to study it. I believe that all would benefit from an improved understanding of Foundation's bogs and lowlands. Of course, it is not the responsibility of Panyana faculty to pass judgement on others. Our purpose is to advance learning and thus enable others to make better-informed decisions. \r\n\r\nI heard recently however, that even Alcibiana's papers on wetlands do not receive a great readership, which is saddening.
codex.9e2b0a16dc3a6b3a35254b9915bc5071=One other matter has impacted the enclosed paper, and that is the disruption caused by my college neighbour, Adabo. \r\nShe is wild and disruptive, and does nothing to change the stereotype of Ishgiruans. \r\nMy tutor insists that although Adabo is a \"loose cannon\", her work has an \"impulsiveness and vitality,\" that mine lacks. Apparently she has produced \"many fine designs for the wings of ships\". \r\n\r\nI'm sorry to say it, but I doubt very any of this is her own work, she simply wouldn't have had the time to produce it. \r\nShe'll invite herself into my room and start opening and closing the windows, or shifting the cushions about, or crumpling the sheets I have set exactly right that morning. She will discuss irrelevances to pass the time, time that we could both better spend focussing on our totally unrelated fields of study. Out of politeness I have found myself humouring her right up until she leaves, which can be as much as an hour later.\r\n\r\nShould these papers not be well-understood or received, I cite these moments as significant distractions for which I can provide material evidence if needed.
codex.6fdf43449a542f0e1184ec7325f23f9e=The festival has become so popular that it shall now be held four times a year. The idea is that the cutlery we show is seasonal, like Autumn last year with Freakus and Darsh Hussett providing some fine soup ladles made of sap-heavy maple. Maple never makes a drop of sap late in the year you see, so you should cut the tree in those months, or you won't get the same deep colour.\r\n\r\nThe next event is 14th Lopus. As it's spring, the cutlery we're looking for for has to be made with hardwood, and spring themes, like flowers or young animal families. The judge will be the Warlock of the Afternoon, from down the road in Putty city, and we'll have spring rabbit and onions in the pot for the hungry.
codex.1b777f4752ff1bed7ba6df26722fecc5=(A tentative translation from the original Gallish by Archdean Cambrina)\n\nIt's an accepted fact that the Pekoe, in spite of their arcane lifestyle, deserve respect. One can't help but think that this is because they are so useful to us, thanks to the success of the great hospital at Capulca (though even if the hospital weren't there, the Pekoe would carry on just the same). Yet the prevailing assumption is that the Pekoe are the only people of Koinos we should care about. In reality there are hundreds of tribes deeper in the jungle, all with a comparable level of knowledge and connection to nature. Lately many of these tribes have been lost, giving up their own values and culture and moving within the comforting bounds of Capulca.
codex.ef428b5073400de24b9973e8a5f89e64=Koinos remains, even after two-hundred years of sky travel, an underexplored land. The lack of open spaces for landings and the fearsome Twy-ni-Banda snake are a challenge for even the most intrepid skyfarer. Long may it remain so - lest we disturb the symbiosis these tribes share with their surroundings. \nThe Tamoe for instance, who are often mistaken for the Pekoe, are progenitors of many of the ideas used by their better-known neighbours. Their language and lifestyle however, is entirely different. They revere and learn from the small mammals of Koinos that have adapted to outwit the snakes.\n\nIt doesn't end there. Gaining an understanding of the snake-men of far west Koinos has enabled us to discover previously unknown uses for Twy-ni-Banda venom. The snake-men attempt in all ways to align with the snakes, and much of their adolescence is spent emulating the behaviour of snakes, in order that both human and reptile can coexist within their communities. The venom is used at Capulca hospital for all kinds of treatments.
codex.6388f91851af168d6d6bee95baf34df4=Such ingenuity is ubiquitous. The Intucki tribe of south Koinos for instance, have over the course of many generations, learned the art of constructing sand fortresses along the southern coast. Water is anathema to the snakes and so the Intucki use fire to bait them out to the sand, before snaring them and cooking them over an open fire. If it weren't for the snakes an inhabitant of a bustling Metropolis like Fasio, Kubo, or Ten-Rui might think this simple life bliss. \n\nFinally, the Shamoe tribe of north Koinos are as fascinating as any. We know they live deep inland, but all other information on them is based on the stories told by the Pekoe and others. This is because no northerner has ever actually seen them, and it is this expert camouflage that has kept them safe from the Twy-ni-Banda.
codex.7de47dc77930e120d094fed2493bd2d2=All this makes recent developments all the more troubling. The amount of money arriving in Capulca could change the Pekoe. Though the amenities are basic and in many cases token (quaint shops, and nods to the Gallish pantheic calendar for example) there is no doubt they are at the sweet spot between traditional and modern living. Their proximity to the coast, in an area relatively thin with jungle fauna and numbers of Twy-ni-banda, means they are a safe bet for medicinal tourists. But how long will it be before they themselves start to lose touch with their own traditions? \r\n\r\nI asked their leader Ah-Nut what he thought.\r\n\r\n\"The hospital is very important to us. We are grateful for it, but we hope this is where it ends. We have a lot of clean rooms now to help our patients feel comfortable and safe, but all our medicine begins and ends out there, in the forest.\"\r\n\r\nThose too, are my observations. For now, the Pekoe have the balance right. Let us hope that is how they continue.

Capulca, the Hospital and surrounds shall be known as the \"Gateway to the Jungle\", and native peoples shall be evicted from the area, so that a proper colony is allowed to prosper.\n\n2. The snakes shall be exterminated, even from any refuge they take below ground.\n \n3. The continent known as Koinos, of which Capulca and the Hospital is but a minute part, shall be renamed Lammonland in my honour.\n\nHaving constructed the apothecary and hospice at the settlement of Capulca, I fully expect this to develop into a full-fledged colony, so long as we can be rid of the wretched reptile.
codex.ef32aed4e2ab3c67cd12b754e7270ffb=(excerpt from an Ishgiru article)\n\n...embarrassing first dialogue in Mellifluan, wherein the Saborian \"expert\" confused the word \"agreement\" with the word for \"foliage\". \n\nThe Saborian diplomats thought they were bringing Melliflua and Sabor into an alliance against Chabuti, while their counterparts presumed they were tabling some sort of horticultural exchange program. In the end the matter was cleared up, but it's no surprise the agreement they signed was a flimsy one. It wasn't long before Kioki swooped in and made peace between Melliflua and Chabuti, which suited them much better. That was when the Saborians really bit...
codex.6a0bbf7fba29f6130fcbd550880a1e53=...What is noticeable, especially in the last century or so, is how insistent the Saborians have been on communicating solely in their own language. They pride themselves on breeding ignorance, almost, toward the rest of Foundation. Most Saborians behave as if Sabor is the world. \r\nIshgiruan is the second most spoken language, but by contrast, having at least a command of the basic platitudes in other languages is essential to good business there.

The land is tainted, grumbling, our wool is thin and dry on the loom.\r\n\r\nAgonon is rising, he disturbs the soil. His shackles are weakened, his body writhes and his mouth opens. Shabo is afraid, and Baliandri will not help, since it is not her quarrel. Once the boulder is overturned, all hundred of Agonon's legs shall bear him up, and he shall begin the great construction of the heavens anew. \r\n\r\nWe humans are so small that Agonon will not notice us, and we shall drown and dive and be crushed. The Saborians and their mines will collapse, the earth itself will turn, as it has in Kampina. We enter the eye of destruction, as the orbs collide.  \r\n\r\nWith our last breath, we honour those who fought for us. Those who risked everything to preserve. The angel of Kubo, young Lois, whose heart was bound to Alika's, and we saw them eaten by a creature of the deep.
codex.36645e8a6144b2b35fff2c1058333b64=Ramblings in a survivor's notebook, probably written a few years after the 'breathing in'.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days of the end of the occupation, there was a trial. All those who had pledged, or were believed to have pledged affiliation to the Yellow Blood Penitents were brought en masse to the courthouse in Driss.\r\n\r\n\"You are accused of inciting racial hatred, of treason, and of slander against the nation of Bandinia, which is your home.\"
codex.412d30e1e7e9d57ff9cabaab61332c52=Witnesses came forward and corroborated the claims. The reaction of some of the jury was vitriolic;\r\n\r\n\"You talk of the burden of shame. You are our burden of shame, your lot have brought Bandinia down for centuries. Your attitudes are prehistoric, you shackle us, you make us feel worthless. You are the reason we have never stood up and fought.\"\r\n\r\nOthers were more moderate;\r\n\r\n\"The Penitents are part of our heritage. They are not directly responsible for any of this. We're making them scapegoats, when it is our oppressors who are to blame. Just think how they made Bandinians their scapegoats, how their failings since Alkabar were put on us, and then decide if these Penitents deserve punishment.\"
codex.cf665ca4117f626317cc4e729dd50eb1=The final verdict came from the judge, a man of Darat. He was not a noble, but born to an ordinary family. It was time for the ordinary people to take Bandinia back. For the first time, the traditionally secular court enforced a religious matter. \r\n\r\n\"The penitents are free to go, but on one condition; they must agree to bear shame not just for the actions of Alkabar or Bandinia, but for all people. All people are guilty. This stipulation is to be written unconditionally into the teachings of the Penitent faith. \"\r\n\r\nBeing both lenient and sensible, the verdict satisfied all. The majority of the Penitents, many of whom had suffered as much as anyone else in the camps, adopted the new religion. Those that refused to, were sentenced to death.
codex.79c9f8332aa59e669c8b0a7a082ad604=The trials continued. There were many more obvious crimes to answer, most commonly abetting slavery, or committing treason for personal gain. Of course, Vilanthrus and King Orthosa had already been killed, and could therefore not be tried. But as a notable footnote, those responsible the palace coup were themselves tried and found guilty of murder. The sentence was reduced on account of their having strong motives for forcibly removing Orthosa from power.  \r\nThe sombre mood of the trials, which lasted for more than three years - the same length of time as the occupation itself - eventually made way for a bright and joyous feeling, a honey-sweet time of celebration. A last deep gasp of air, before everything went under.
codex.d4935c100b847af5d4180f14230e2025=There was a funny coronation. The crowns and mantles were placed over the shoulders of the new King and Queen - young parents who raised seven children through the occupation in downtown Darat, and somehow survived. They smiled, they were modest, they were perfect for the throne. There was a banquet to which all the guests brought home-cooked food, candelabras were lit and crooked music was played on crooked trumpets.\r\n\r\nSinkholes opened up across the gardens of Calipolon, and other subsidences were a daily occurrence. Still, Driss made merry, and its people lived the life. Even when sandstorms grew violent enough to kill, survivors danced out afterward, scattering rose petals on the bodies it had rubbed out.\r\n\r\nI think they all knew of the war in the north, but no one cared. For ten years, Bandinia would be free, like it had never been free before.

codex.1656d763348e870e04875f5c050e702a=IV. All must keep their pistol clean and fit for service. A morning polish is recommended by quartermaster Snark, and perhaps one at the end of the day too. More than two polishes a day might be deemed excessive, though it guarantees the weapon has an agreeable filigree pedigree.
codex.e15b5cff1f236ee87910968affc015aa=V. Crewmen deserting Karkinos during battle is fine by the captain, since he loves to watch fraidy-cats bounce on the rocks below.

Don't I always tell you how confined I feel, with only a court and gardens to explore, when you have five leagues square of trees, lakes, rivers, boats and beasts? Yet the Empress remains locked in her bedroom. I must find her among the cushions mornings, hoping she has not suffocated.\r\n\r\nI have only an inkling as to her distress, which is that it concerns the fate of the lower city. It is not for me to judge, mother, but I have tolerated her swooning fits as much as I am able. I admire her person, but no longer her suitability as Empress. That the Empress must inherit, and can never be sensibly chosen, is perhaps the biggest failing of our state.  \r\n\r\nEveryone knows the details of the war. Gruesome details - it has been in the news everywhere, and all anyone speaks of in the summer garden. The Saborians have been made to seem like the snakes of Koinos. Do they really have no conscience? I long to be the negotiator, to see them for myself. \r\n\r\nI have often wondered what it would be like to sit in the Empress' chair, or to be her sister a-waiting. Would I let money matters sway my resolve, or perhaps the Warlock? What mysteries he wields, if any, I would not fear. See how brittle he is, day-by-day, in his ill-guided schemes. If I were Empress, I would revise our structures, and close this war. But this is not Gall, there is no woman of power here, least of all our poor Empress.\r\n\r\nIf she should die, I will be shown the door. I will open it gladly, then fly to you, because it has been too long. \r\n\r\nLove,\r\n\r\nYour Daughter.

She told me afterward that the storekeeper didn't let her have the special goods, and would only give her Ogballs. Of course I was angry, I turned 'round to her and said, \"you're as mortal as they come\".\r\n\r\nI went myself, and it seems there isn't much to be had. Do you know what's going on? \r\n\r\nRhodea.

The replicas are adequate, but the Pinnish ones are lovelier. Soon these replicas will be made on a larger scale and distributed for half a yellow stamp. I daresay it would be easier if we just exchanged some of our own goods for the genuine toys, but the Economist prohibits it.\r\n\r\nStill, I couldn't resist.

I am now too frail for the journey's undertaking. Though for two-hundred and seventy-six years we Pin have been bystanders, it is now imperative you let us have our say, as it was agreed by our ancestors. \r\n\r\nWe've had little reason to question your sound oversight. But now that our forests are being torn down by those claiming to have the \"permissions of the Empress\", we must petition you. These Ishgiruan interlopers are of course greedy to excavate Atlas, or lately, wanting space to construct boviaries for fuel.  \r\n\r\nCould these men take their business elsewhere? The Green Islands perhaps? We suggest giving up pursuit of Atlas altogether, as it is leading us all up the mountain. Most of us here agree that returning to simple seafaring might in the short-term seem a bit of a backwards step, but would in the long-term help preserve the world that crumbles around us.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have received your letter, and call to arms. The people of Pin will continue to help defend Kioki from all invaders, provided the aforementioned terms of this letter are heard. \r\n\r\nCarmone Limontina\r\nElder of Pin

After everything I've heard they don't seem so bad, and they brought us Saborian bonbons. They're made with sugar, ogball flour, peaches and nanban. \nThey said Jee and I were fine young ladies, and I could see they meant it. They were mostly gentlemanly, except when they laughed at our make-up, said women in Sabor didn't need paint to look good. I didn't take offence - just one of those little differences, besides I'm not sure they all agreed!\n\nIt sounded like they wanted the war to end too, because there didn't seem much cause to fight any more. They said the Kioki won't hear Sabor's pleas. Never heard that one before.\n\nLater, some of the old songs got played. The Essedari didn't know them and couldn't sing along, and that marked them out.

Silver helm and tabard, sun, and the two moons huddled up.\r\n\r\nWe called on Verduba, who always understand. \r\n\r\nWe called on Melliflua, Chabuti, who are blind and deaf to it all.  \r\n\r\nWe ate the worm. We ritualled beneath the moon, we marked the ground with our water.\r\n\r\nWe spoke of the other battle, their battle. We said it had been fought too long, and we held love for neither side. It is not ours to fight. \r\n\r\n\"Yet there are earth-rumbles, so we must make it our battle,\" the Envoys said. \r\n\r\nWe agree the earth rumbles in anger, and that something must be done.

codex.2799fa36706fee1c71105a46d06fbe54=I was told the only Warlock who'd meet me outside of a sand circle was on sabbatical in the deep dark recesses of Koinos. Not the eastern Pekoe region, but the overgrown snake-infested belly, which even in this intrepid age remains uncharted.\r\n\r\nI had six trim Bandini to carry the bags, a hardy pack beast (who in the end we were forced to return to the skyship as he found the going too uneven), and at the front the small consortium who'd plan our progress beyond the bald promontory upon which we'd landed. \r\n\r\nI'd been told to meet the Warlock of the Metal at the Shrine of Owls, but that we'd have to navigate there on foot. A tramp beneath the trees, where vegetation scored our arms like black glass. As we set off, the Bandini formed a shield around us, beating the undergrowth to out the vermin snake the locals call \"Twy-ni-Banda\". These serpents are so numerous, and their bite so toxic, that there was every chance we wouldn't make it.\r\n\r\nSure enough, on the very first day, a Bandini was bitten between the toes. Enduring his screams, we comforted him through to the end knowing there was nothing to be done. When he was dead, we lit a pyre. Even the Twy-ni-Banda seemed to keep a respectful distance from the fire, until a squall came and washed it out and we were forced to hurry on.
codex.cc5a59adb0f1b31a7e4445ad0babbd47=After three days of fitful sleep in the boughs of the trees (it is lucky the snakes rarely climb) and swimming under improbable waterfalls, we found the shrine. A glittering line of seventy-one Ishgiruans were waiting expectantly for us on the steps.\r\nWe embraced them firmly, both because it seemed the honourable thing to do, and also because we were so utterly relieved. \r\n\r\nMetal wore the suitably inappropriate; an encumbrance of currency threaded around the neck, a heap of skin-piercing jewellery in his ears and an Empress-green and gold skirt that he trailed in the dirt. Metal argued that by corollary of its length and thick lining, the skirt acted as defence against the Twy-ni-Banda, of whom all present parties were understandably terrified.    \r\n\r\nThe Shrine of Owls, I am told, is more than five-thousand-years-old. By the two moons, that is long before Sabor came into being. Metal believes, to a fault, that the lineage of the Empress is at least as ancient. Still, a study of the shrine kindled a connection for him. He said, \"it is no coincidence we Ishgiruans also hold owls, hawks and peregrines in similarly high regard.\"\r\n\r\nI myself had the eerie feeling that I knew the place, yet had never been there. It seems to confirm the Gall view that Koinos was home to us all once.
codex.d7d6447e30a9147323e4a1a47524219f=Thankfully the Shrine of Owls is a haven from the ungodly snakes. There is a moat around it, and the snakes are not keen swimmers. Whoever built it must have known. \n\nThe meeting seemed a mutually profitable exchange, for the Warlock of Metal said he was much enthused by Saborian life, and that he longed the Unity might one day become so uniform and fair. I provided an explanation of how that could be achieved, but he quickly snubbed me, remarking that our system was \"quite extreme\".\n\n\"I fear it is just not the way things are. You see, the Empress has special and ancient bonds. The Book of Soil says her reign must continue, or our race will uncoil, and the separate strands of the rope wither and grow weak,\" he said. \nHe did explain however, that following his residency here in the forest, he was hopeful that a generous sum might scatter from the Empress Tarramaggi's pockets and cascade down upon her extended family like a water fountain. \n\nHe had a merchant with him, Nabob Tyrese. A man whose only fondness was for eating. He refused to walk anywhere, and it was infuriating to discover the both of them had actually been winched down into the forest from a skyship, rather than (as I had been led to believe) making the arduous trek, which had cost my own caravan so dear.\n\nA fine banquet was prepared for us, a long table in the Ishgiru style filling the grand hall at the top of the steps.\n\"Tyrese is here to see if this land has prospects,\" said Metal.\n\"I see,\" I said, curiously, since I had a similar errand to run on behalf of the Sabor Assembly.\n\"There's nothing here,\" said the Nabob dismally, as he chewed a cube of cold butter, \"only stinking snakes.\"   \r\n\"We hope that our skyship may return shortly, for we have had our fill of the wild,\" said Metal.\r\n\"Not enough women,\" smirked the blotchy-faced Tyrese.
codex.a0f76aa590ac9e9bc2c3d0e3ee2ad3f8=\"We must elevate Ten-Rui to the status of the Saborian cities\", said Metal over dessert.\r\n\r\nI wasn't so sure it could be done.\r\n\r\n\"There is no such thing as a \"citizen\" of the Kioki Unity,\" he laughed, \"All are welcome in Ten-Rui, but they must make their own way. Success is only equivalent to effort!\" \r\n\r\nI looked at Metal and wondered if he or his friends had ever had to work to get by. But there was no arguing with them. \r\n\r\nLater, Metal showed me a strange thing with flower stamens. He put them in water, and they dyed it yellow. He dipped his finger in and stirred, then he daubed it upon my cheeks, and said I was now \"in the Karem style\". I was promptly asked for a sizeable donation to their cause, which I felt I ought not refuse. I found myself signing off a shipment of myrrh against my book of entitlement. \r\n\r\nIncredulous I said, \"Metal, these magikal arts of yours are little more than a sham.\"\r\nBut he laughed again. As long as he was paid, he could never take offence.

Now, at night her friends the moons speak the same way. I place candles into the mouths of Cristella, and I turn the dial for each of my prayers. \n\nCreation, I lit a candle of ambrette, for the seeds of life itself.  \n\nPreservation, a candle of cherry blossom, for the bloom and beauty of it.\n\nDestruction, a candle of deathly white petals, for which there is no fitting end. \n\nFor Limbo, I prayed in the violence of silence.\n\nI lit a fifth for rebirth, and the resumption of the cycle thereafter.
codex.91f35cb3d0de4d81a5171ef96fb1120b=The Mount of Plenty is certainly one of my favourite spots, but lately I have stopped painting it. \r\n\r\nAs a young man, the lake was one of the designs I was expected to replicate, every painting the same as the last. Landscapes dashed with bold strokes of colour. By 2850, the sylph movement had begun, and like many artists I'd begun to depict the tiny people that inhabit everything. My landscapes became backdrops, the little sylphies floating across the foreground, spangling the lake creatures with their aetherial shimmer, as such agents of Aetherium are wont to do.\r\n\r\nBy then, the Momoros scene was flourishing, and I met visitors from all over Foundation. The abstracts from Melliflua, illustrators of the Verduban muscular school. Once we had learned all they had to teach, they were sent home, and we plastered the walls of Momoros with mimicry of their styles. It was a great time, and I met a beautiful girl. She was slender like a sylphie and I fell in love.
codex.fb0748d95fc04091da9a81779f059e59=But love took me to a dark place, for the sylphie betrayed me. She took another in the Boros. How hard it was to ascend after that. How horrible a distraction from my painting. And of course, there was no sympathy. That was not the Saborian way.\r\n\r\nBy then the Boros had got out of hand. The Committee even closed the Boros for a while, said there were too many of us, but it was too late for me. I never saw my sylphie again.\r\n\r\nNow if I sit before the lake, brush in hand, I don't see sylphies, I see her face, and I can't paint.
codex.2494b9ad1fbc78badc8bd79859860c9b=The old town is a greyness, like dust under a carpet. The river runs grey, like old dead blood. No citizens here; all have been scooped up to the habitats of the new city. Who cares about the old town, when the sleek intersections above it are so diverting? Each beam and brace manufactured the same, the even bustle of daily routines, each face and chest glowing in the marigold sun. \r\nMomoros' beautiful and rosy children dance through the morning. In the cloistra, they slip and slap upon the marble walkways between pools, and fling themselves fearlessly towards the first platforms of the Apotheon. \r\n\r\nBeneath the south Godhand Terminal, is a vast metallic udder, with brass pods for teats. A mechanical conveyance swings across to it, delivering packages through one of its many square apertures. The finished products erupt from the backside of the beast, and are collected by a bulbous cargo vessel.  \r\n\r\nInside the udder, young men and women, toiling happily, affix nuts and washers to panels, beating the machines with the rattle of progress. Above them, the angel of apotheosis hangs symbolic, hovering above all lest they lose faith for a moment in their godliness, and shirk their duty.  \r\n\r\n\"We are gods!\" comes the beatific cry, as it must always do, once every minute.\r\n\r\nIt's is here that the Gallish designs are followed to the letter. The engines are sheer and sleek. Each template is matched, and the foreman checks each piece for defects. When the sun is halfway high, there is a short interval, then work resumes. All the workers are happy, they are safe, well-fed. They know that one day, they will be allotted a kinder challenge - a seat in the assembly, or pool duty at one of the cloistra.\r\n\r\nBut the greyness undermines. Its imperfection taints.

For example, although there are distinct and punishing class structures in Ishgiru life,  there exist no nuances of language directly attributable to status. We can perhaps put this down to the ingrained multi-ethnicity of the city of Ten-Rui. \r\nBut in Sabor, the tripartite structure of actual and linguistic society has the remarkable effect of placing the Citizens and Bandini on a level with language. That they use the same terminology is indicative of their frequent interaction. Meanwhile the Pilipai, the middle wedge of the Saborian population, have very much their own grammar, vocabulary and intonation.

It seems there are no jobs but in the choking pits of Atlas, and a hank of cheese values the same as a modest house under her ladyship's unripe regimen. Such is the case from the bay of Pipinturi all the way up the scarf of Ishgiru to Ten-Rui. \nToday we see the aspirational rise of a new Warlock, the Warlock of the Gloam, Empress' puppeteer, and next in a long line of these elitist flunkies. From the chalk circles of Karem, in which he defended against competitors Warlocks Moss and Mole-sight, he seems to wholly represent the grotesque lifestyle of the upper echelon. His \"policies\" are the arbitrations of his own personality cult, and his interests, have no doubt, concern only the filthy merchant authority and their nabobs.\n\nIn the coming years will we know the extent of his depravity, but sources suggest the man is bitter megalomaniac with a tragic past, as one discrete source told us;\n\"I knew him when he was a boy in the town of Putty, his name were Dawy and he lost his sweetheart to the Karem river. She drowned at cripple's weir they say, and think it were him that pushed her. At the time he said it were she what did herself in, but family and friends say she weren't the type - full of life and fun.\"\nWe should be afraid, not of the man's magics, but his menace. Unless we come together, as did the old town under Empress Getta Renata, how else can we dispel the storms above, or the rattles and shakes of the lowtown? We must form a true and proper unity to unseat the false one. A Unity that unites, not exploits its citizens like pocket coin.... \nContinued on page 4.
codex.3bcf86362ae0ef4b4ac9ea552acc781d=From Vaduva's Autobiography \"No Glove Lost\"\r\n\r\nWhen I first met Taranoi, I didn't like him. He just seemed to be in it for the money, but I took a contract with him all the same. His team was Birikoi Buglers, bottom of the second tier. After a match we blew against the Eastern Jewels, he told me I had a bad game, and that if I wanted to stick around I'd have to do an awful lot better.\r\n\r\nI didn't speak to him for months, let the others fob him off with excuses why I wasn't around. Sure enough my deal ran out after a game against Driss Leopards, when were beaten in an hour without scoring a point.\r\nI went to the bar, and Taranoi was there waiting. I tried to avoid him, but he came up to me.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"What the hell was that?\" \r\n\r\nDidn't say anything about the fact I hadn't spoken to him in all that time. Didn't say anything about the contract, just went straight for the jugular.

Why don't you show it on the lallara court?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"'cos someone went and got me locked up.\"  \r\n\r\nWe laughed about it, and he promised me when I got out that he'd take me on again. Bear in mind I was twenty-one at the time, I had no real prospects in the game, and Taranoi was my chance to get noticed. \r\n\r\nQuestion was, what team was I gonna play for? The Birikoi Buglers were real bad. It was always gonna be hard for me to shine in such a sea of average. \r\n\r\nI said, \"Ok, I'll play for you. But not for the Buglers.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"If you're not playing for the Buglers, you not playing for me.\"\r\n\r\nAgreeing to play for the Buglers was the best decision I ever made.
codex.fcd2a6f0abeadaaf8be380ce1cd45d8d=Next season came round and the national team had their pick of the best players for the international cup. I was a nobody, there was no chance of me going. But for the Buglers, this was an opportunity. The division lost Bellari, Vascukz, Omil, some of the best in Bandinia - and all the teams were that bit weaker. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, we picked up some help. Challia from the beach club was great in defence, which was where our problems were. Then there was me, back out of jail, and I was determined not to look back.\r\n\r\nIt didn't start well though. Our first game was against relegated Darat Miners. They'd lost a few players to Darat City - who had the backing of the royal family - but otherwise they had loyal players who didn't mind dropping down a division if the team was gonna go straight back up. \r\n\r\nWe got beat easy. Afterwards I told the lads, \"we did ok out there, they were a good team.\" But Taranoi was on my back again, \"Konstini,\" he said, \"You're my Captain, and you're telling those dungdips they played well? It's my turn to hit you or the conk if you don't get your act together.\"\r\nWhy always pick on me, I thought. But I took it out on the lads instead, giving them a few words about how we needed to step up or step out.\r\n\r\nIt worked. The next game we played like a dream.
codex.804b9696d2c04c4a48170238a8d7813d=We didn't quite get promotion come the end of the year, but I scored so many points and assists that someone was bound to come knocking. I was offered a choice, Darat Miners, who'd gone straight back up to the big league, or champions Darat City. \r\n\r\nI knew I wouldn't start for City, and since my dad had been a miner, I picked the underdogs. Years later I met the King, and he asked why I didn't pick Darat City. Obviously I didn't tell him the real reason, so I told him about my dad instead. I remember he said I was \"quaint,\" and that I \"wouldn't have fitted in anyway.\"\r\n\r\nMy last season was the 2950 campaign. By then I held all the records, and the miners had aced the title fourteen times, more than any other team. \r\n\r\nI was still the main man in the Bandinian national team. But the cup in 2950 left a sour taste in the mouth. A lot of people were hanging around the team at the tournament in Melliflua, and it didn't help us one bit. There was a lot of money changing hands, and a lot of our players weren't on great money. \r\n\r\nOn the court the big moment was in the first game, when the umpire, a Saborian, kept giving fouls against us. Obviously we complained, but rumours were going around about us by then, and the organisers ignored the complaint. After that we were fighting a losing battle, and Bandinia didn't make the second round for the first time on record. The Mellifluans had a pretty good team, and 'though they had nothing on us, they ended up winning it in the end.
codex.dff53f8692ee0bb591bdd7b60e216aee=I stepped away from the game, and Taranoi and I spent the next few years as partners, getting his products as good as they could be. It was satisfying, especially since retirement was so hard for me to begin with. All I ever wanted to do was play lallara, and now that time was gone. Still, I had earned a lot in winnings, and spent my days on the south coast with women and sand and all that stuff. It was pretty great.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I got bored of the party life. It felt like I'd forgotten who I was, so I went back to Darat, back to the Yellow Blood River, and I tried to help the people in the place I grew up. There were a lot of poor kids without much in their lives, so I worked hard to get as many of them as I could into lallara.

This returns the games to its original format, where competitors represented their cities. \r\nIt is unlikely that the games will be opened up to international competition again in the future.\r\n\r\nI know some may be disappointed at this, but it's much healthier for our athletes to have an even playing field, and we should now see more Saborian talent flourish. As part of these changes, some of the events have been shuffled. We see the triumphant return of the bodybuilding competition, and we say a cheerful goodbye to Stilt-Walking, and Lallara, sport of the heathens.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nUtopianist Zelic  \r\n(Chairman of the Aetherial Games Panel)

Blessings be upon him, he is young, and I hope he will see given time, that our own people are bright and have great potential to make wonderful things. But the penitents still drink the yellow blood, and we lack the courage to break free.\r\n\r\nSome of the existing buildings are hundreds of years old. With the shifting earth, and the cracking walls, it's only a matter of time before lives are endangered. If a wall falls, it will flatten the houses. Discussions became so heated yesterday that he threatened to imprison me. I apologised, then he apologised, and we sat down and had dinner together and heard some wonderful music piped from the Challalah. \r\n\r\nWe lost our identity long ago. Drissa still has magic, but there's no reason to go there. I find myself nostalgic for things I know nothing about. What were we like? What wonders did we realise, before the Saborian hand came down, as over an insect, and caught us? It plays with us, tightening, loosening, until the time comes for us to be crushed, and the yellow river run red once more.
codex.3e7a3b5425c05fa7d1b1b3b0c531a61f=<from the article \"great scientists past and present,\" originally written in Mellifluan>\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated scientist of this or any age, Alcibiana is herself, a fascinating subject of study. She was born high in the Kioki foothills to Karem parents. She developed quickly, becoming an avid reader and inquisitive young scholar. Aged eight, she was accompanied by her parents to the Gwendolier institute, in the hope that she might gain admittance. If the entrance examinations are gruelling now, they were more so back then. But being a  prodigious talent, she sailed through.\r\n\r\nHaving graduated from Gwendolier to Panyana, she received the golden locust as a prize for her early flourishes (the locust represents Small, god of youthful voracity). She was known for her commitment to both study and the gods, and could be seen kneeling before the sacred arches at daybreak. She kept iconography of the goddess Icthuna above her bed, and her room at Panyana is now a small museum to her memory, serving as an example to new students of good organisation and focus. It remains a neat, sparsely-decorated room just as it was in her day, which leaves us with few clues as to the real person behind the science. Those who spent time with her remembered her;\r\n\r\n\"She never seemed to need any help with her work, almost to a fault she would pride herself on doing it her way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alcibiana was my best and worst student. We may never know half of the things she came up with, the theories she left unfinished when she died.\"
codex.822c3a6933fea954de3928bca41cf495=It was as if she ignored the acclaim, the prizes, for her discovery of Atlas' properties. Instead she tried to form a unified theory of Foundation's construction. She was never content, never finished. For the rest of her life until her untimely death, she worked feverishly to understand the electrical charges that she claimed existed beneath Foundation's surface. Astonishingly, given the meticulousness of her early career, Alcibiana only wrote a handful of these calculations down. \r\n\r\nIt is said she would lock herself away for hours on end, refusing to eat. It was later discovered (and there is still a chute there today) that she spent much of this time with a spade, digging down as far below Panyana as she could. This explained the many heavy bin bags she would leave outside her room for the maids.\r\n\r\n\"She seemed to stop doing conventional experiments after a time, becoming obsessed with more and more implausible theories, with seemingly no practical examples in nature. Nevertheless she strove to recreate them in the confines of her study, as evidenced by the tunnelling, the manifold materials and machinery. Some say she let success go to her head. I agree, although not in the way they mean it.\"\r\n\r\nTragically she passed away of malnourishment at the age of twenty-seven. Some believe she was a reborn follower of the Saborian creed, and her efforts were part of a scheme to join Aetherium. Her grave overlooks the University, just beyond the arches of the deities of Gall. There are always fresh flowers upon it, and it is just as common to see Gall's young students and supplicants here, as it is to see them at the arches of their gods.

codex.8b5f3b0a5dde961156c8105f794a71ee=One of My Best Cases. \nA selection of true stories, by Stacato Bai. This appears to be a magazine teaser for a longer compilation of memoirs. \n\nThe case of the Saborian extrication.\nA client, Ling, wrote to me asking for assistance. Seeing his letter was from Momoros, Republic of Sabor, I thought twice about obliging. \nI'd been to Sabor a number of times and I'd heard a lot of nonsense, comments about my \"paleness\", and people speaking to me as if I were a simpleton.\nOf course, not one of them knew a word of Verduban, and they were ignorant of every other custom in Foundation besides.\n\nI paid for a ride aboard a transport vessel of Verduban minerals. This must have been its regular route, because there was a deep stench of old fruit aboard. All eyes were soon upon me as I made my way to the terminal building, where Ling was being held in a cell. At the entrance I presented my Verduban authority. \n\n\"You Verdubans all look the same,\" muttered the guard under his breath. I couldn't tell whether he meant for me to hear or not. Then, without explanation, he left the booth by the little door, and wandered off. Having been made to wait for a half hour, I saw no alternative but to walk through the checkpoint. As soon as I tried, I was seized by an odious pair of Godhands, one of whom knocked the cap from my head.\n\n\"What's your business here?\" he said.\n\"I offer legal services.\" \n\"We don't answer to you, you should leave while you still can.\"\nThe Ice God knows I wanted to, but I had come this far, and felt it was my duty to protect my client.\n\"I'd like to be allowed through,\" I said, \"unless there's a good reason for keeping me here.\"
codex.102eedbb0846141b0d83a3ca9d4da6ee=Happily that was the end of it. Something about Verduban openness made the Saborians inherently afraid, as if deep down they knew it was us, not them, that had everything figured out. Perhaps they even looked up to us.\r\n\r\nI was escorted in silence to the cell. I looked in through the bars at Ling.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done now?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh thank the Ice it's you Stacato. It's totally unacceptable this time. I have done nothing, nothing that would incriminate any Saborian.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you aren't a Saborian old friend. You are a Verduban.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever, whatever. Well anyway, I finally managed to ditch my chaperone in a backstreet-\"\r\n\r\n\"-the first crime!\"\r\n\r\n\"-and then I had the pleasure of the city. No-one noticed that I dressed myself in Saborian robes-\"\r\n\r\n\"-the second!\"\r\n \r\n\"-I made for the baths, the forbidden fruit Stacato! I might be the first outside Sabor to have glimpsed its practices. Of course, I should have worn a better disguise-\"\r\n\r\n\"-Three. You went to a cloistrum!?\" \r\n\r\nI couldn't believe my ears. What an idiot.
codex.a1aafe44dfe36f06e6a6954583b2cd80=This pamphlet is intended to affirm the trust we all hold in the laws of this place. I, Pesus, am the Pastor and founder. I was and still am, a boy trapped in a man's body. I am innocence and purity, beholden to nothing but truth. \r\n\r\nMany years ago, we were caught by the Malagawny, the waterspouts. They wound around my craft, and when the hull tore open, mother was drowned, and father swum me to these shores. The effort was exhausting for father, and I could not revive him. \r\n\r\nMy happiness comes from seeing others prosper in thought and deed. Over the years many have come to live here, by chance shipwreck or brave choice. There is always a price to be paid. Anyone who comes to the islands must be prepared to pay that price, just as I did.\r\n\r\nCondemned to live out my orphanage here, I have turned sadness into joy. I have found happiness and contentment where there seemed no hope at all. By following my simple principles you can join us and forge a future for the islands.

Nature has brought us together for a purpose, our minds must be uncluttered. The dome is our one indulgence, it controls the four winds, it is an extension of Malagawny himself.\n\nMalagawny cleanses us. If you pass through his body, your history is cleansed. You are born again, a Green Islander, just as I was. Many who arrive are exiles, criminals, but we don't judge them, or speak further on it. Some leave as quickly, or find this way of life not to their liking. But many more stay behind, and now we have families whose children have never been beyond the spout. From what we hear of Foundation, that can only be a good thing.
codex.db99f7dfa8a7f6496a5c611b8fc3c1ec=We disregard the world beyond Malagawny. Through the years, the one thing that has remained constant is our love for the islands. These islands are not possessions, they have their own minds. The crown is where we reside, where shards of Atlas jut upward and give these islands their name. The orb is where the sheep roam. The sceptre is long and thin. In all these years, I can't say I've covered every blade of grass, but perhaps before I die, I will see the hot springs again, the lake of tar. It is getting harder to make those journeys. Of course, you are not permitted to go to the spirerock cave. An unspeakable witch-woman lives there, commanding spirits to do her bidding with magicks from her books.
codex.7f50bfd05e5271ac9608731c69734202=We disregard religion. We will have no religion brought here to contaminate our love. No sudden warlockery. Malagawny, for example, may be strange and wonderful, but is not god. It is a part of nature. A man came here from Verduba, he said the Ice god was the only way. In the end he drove himself mad trying to convince us. I had the others tie his arms and legs with heavy bags of sand. Each had a small corner cut away for the sand to escape gradually. When after five days his hands were worn from struggle, but enough sand had emptied that he could move again, he agreed not to speak of his Ice god again. One night he simply took a boat and left\nto peddle his lies elsewhere.
codex.a3c74e8d7c65ed7839d0be791048d63a=We disregard our problems. If you want to live here, we ask that you set the problems of your former life aside. Bringing these problems to us will only spread a negativity that doesn't exist on the island.\n\nWe breed acceptance. I marry who I choose, for it is my right as pastor. Accept the rules of the islands and we shall have no complaint. The rules are simple enough to live by, so keep to them, and preserve the beauty, peace and love we have here. Our calendar is comprised of seventeen months like others, but our months are divided not into two weeks of eleven days, but into twenty-two weeks of two days. One is a day of rest, the other of toil. You will be given a job shortly, such as fisherman, bread-maker. If you have no experience of your craft then you'll quickly learn.\n\nWelcome. Please circulate this pamphlet.

codex.70dd159e033a5ece2200be4291efe68a=This is the story of Woolly. Woolly was a kraken, and he loved his mummy. They swam the seas and ate plankton the whole day through.\r\n\r\nOne day Woolly lost sight of his mummy in a great storm. He was so tired, he swam upstream to rest in the warm shallows.\r\n\r\nHe saw a strange man with a stick there. \"I am god of this land. Go away or I'll eat you,\" he said. He seemed so certain of himself that Woolly swam away.\r\n\r\nHe looked for his mummy at sea, but had no luck, and grew tired. Again, he swam upstream to rest in the warm shallows.\r\n\r\nHe saw a womanly figure at a loom there. She was weaving a red tapestry made with beetle blood. But Woolly found her company dull, so Woolly swam away.\r\n\r\nHe looked for his mummy at sea, but had no luck, and grew tired again. He was sad. He swam upstream to rest in the warm shallows.\r\n\r\nHe saw a lady with a large hat there, but she was so busy with her studies that she shushed poor Woolly, so Woolly swam away.\r\n\r\nHe looked for his mummy at sea, but had no luck, and grew tired again. He was very sad. He swam upstream to rest in the warm shallows.\r\n\r\nHe saw a nude man wandering there. Woolly was embarrassed, so Woolly swam away.\r\n\r\nHe looked for his mummy at sea, but had no luck, and grew tired again. He was very very sad. He swam upstream to rest in the warm shallows.\r\n\r\nHe saw a beautiful Empress trapped in a tiny box brimming with gold. Woolly wanted to help her, but her soldiers ushered him away.\r\n\r\nHe looked for his mummy at sea, but had no luck, and grew tired again, and was terribly sad, and he wept and wept. He swam upstream to rest in the warm shallows.\r\n\r\nAnd there in the shallows was mummy! She wrapped him up in her ten legs. He loved her, and she him. They swam out to sea, and ate as much plankton as they could stomach.
codex.0b84d4e9cb650cc9d2dbb1bde45bca6d=My husband Mateo is at war, and the house is quiet, but for the sound of the Elders, who rattle and drone. \r\n\r\n\"Breaking point...Crisis...Chabuti...Mining...Responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't preach to me about responsibility!\" I curse at the radio. I have a six-year old boy, who needs his mummy all hours of the day, and there's no dad here to help. Not that daddy was ever much help.\r\n\r\nI put the little long-neck scarf around Nuno's neck, and watch him fall asleep. He is poorly today, which means I have a chance to catch my breath. You see, Nuno isn't like the other boys. Normally, he is flying around the house. He likes to break things, and sometimes he's angry and he hits himself on the head or hits me until I can calm him down. Mateo always used to go out for \"fresh air\". He couldn't cope at all.\r\n\r\nI wanted another little one, but he wouldn't have it. He said one was hard enough, he said he such a cruel world didn't deserve another Nuno. That's how I knew he loved his boy.\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing was the goatbear festival. Nuno didn't get it, and the goatbears scared him. A lot of people didn't understand, and they avoided us. We lost a lot of friends that way, though it wasn't our fault. \r\n\r\nWhat we needed to do was stick together, but Lafite and I grew further apart. The war was the perfect excuse. I sometimes wonder if he hadn't been killing Saborians, whether he'd have been here, killing us.

codex.400470c5f50c0eb53b7ebce8a966f14e=Said the supreme Prince Ursulus, \"Saddle a wild cat to transport me to Agbana, for I wish to meet this princess. I intend to marry her, and to bond our peoples to theirs.\" \r\n\r\nThese were the days when power rested in the hands of the few, and such behaviour was common. Ursulus rode the wild cat for a month through the green pastures of the north. He took in the sights of the country, and the work of his people, whom he called the \"Pilipai\", since they were happy to live outside the city. His entourage of fifty men and women saw to his every whim.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourth week he arrived in Agbana, anxious to see the foreign princess about whom all the people had remarked. Ursulus invited her to his private parlour, so that he could propose. Awaiting her were great citrus cakes, and game pies, and carafes of the finest wines, and a golden chequerboard table for the feast to rest upon. But when the princess arrived, supreme Prince Ursulus spewed his wine down his best toga. \r\n\r\nThe foreign princess turned out to be a gigantic rat, with the bushiest bulging cheeks, and the sleekest pinkest ears.
codex.5c00adfa2385ad78c3b0b68863a967b9=\"What is the meaning of this!\" said the prince, though he sounded more afraid than angry.\r\n\r\n\"ScRee, scrEE!\" squealed the Princess of the Wahsili. \r\n\r\nIt was then that the Scribe Varius spoke up. Scribe Varius was conversant in the rat language, having learned of their existence from the Mellifluans. \r\n\r\n\"She says she is pleased to arrive in these arid lands, and would like to sample the soil to see if it has a suitable composition for the construction of a subterranean burrow for her people.\"\r\n\r\nTaken aback, Prince Ursulus thought for a moment, then asked, \"do her people not have a home already?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scree, Scree ScreE, Scree, sCree,\" said the princess, when Varius had put the question to her.\r\n\r\n\"She says that there is a terrible war in the place she calls the burrow, and that the Gold Tabards and Silver Helms, and the Wild Feet, and the Pick-Claws have lost many to the conflict. She says her own clan, the Moon-Lovers, are waiting upon her notice to board a fleet of ships and sail to our shores to start anew.\"
codex.8595d9378d5ee907f208c50a0db6522c=Instead of rejecting the proposal out of hand, the prince took pity and said, \"We have space, plenty of space, and if the rats are underground then we shall not see them to worry about them. Besides this young lady has spirit. Bring a sample of soil from every place as she asks.\" And so the message was passed to the councils of each of the four duchies that they must return their soils.\r\n\r\nHaving few other obligations whilst waiting for the samples of soil to be returned, the prince made the effort, with the help of Varius, to learn the Wahsili language. He and the princess were thus able to spend many evenings together walking in the gardens, conversing over life, politics, and the \"Lighter of the Lamps\", the great prize for which all Wahsili wars were fought. The princess was strong-minded and inquisitive, and in spite of her appearance, the prince found himself falling in love.
codex.ed525e87e4b66bb6154c672c11c5c49c=The soils were presented to her at the first opportunity, and she perused each of the phials. One was from nearby Agbana, the place at which her solitary boat had landed. One was from the delta at Momoros and Redusa, one from the Studded Desert to the south, and one from the foothills east of Bandinia. The prince would not spare soil from the Mount of Plenty, since he did not wish to disrupt the harmony of that place for anything.\r\n\r\n\"This is too wet and clay-like,\" she said of the delta soil, \"and this too brittle and filled with with stones and minerals,\" in regard to the sample from the Studded Desert.\r\n\r\n\"And what of the others?\" said the prince, who was disappointed not to see her expectations met. The princess sniffed the remaining soils, clawed them, held them up to the light, and even had a little taste. \r\n\r\n\"The Bandinian soil is too barren, I fear  the glowworms will not proliferate there. The Agbanese soil is far too fine and sandy, it would collapse over our heads. I fear we will not be able to make a burrow here at all.\"
codex.52fda1faedc1324c9e005551715d274d=The princess told Prince Ursulus that she would have to return home to her clan, and try to find a way to resolve the war instead. The prince implored her to remain in Sabor, offering her his hand in marriage. \r\n\r\n\"Your offer is kind, but I cannot accept,\" she said. \r\n\r\n\"Why not, my love?\"\r\n\r\n\"On account of your nauseating scent.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince was upset, but before locking himself away to grieve, he bestowed upon the princess a new and wonderful ship with which to return to the Wahsili desertlands.\r\n\r\nThe prince watched sadly as the princess left the harbour, and he waved a great banner over the castle of Agbana in a last attempt to change her mind. But the princess was resolved to return to the burrows of the Wahsili, and to make peace among her people.\r\n\r\nDuring her voyage, a leak sprung in the gilded ship she had been given, and try as she might, the princess could not stem the flow of water. The ship flooded, and though the water was warm, the rat-people had never learned to swim. \r\n\r\nOf course, Prince Ursulus knew this, for he had schemed her demise in advance. You see, the prince had vowed that if he could not love the princess, then no-one should be allowed to.\r\n\r\nHe'd waved his flag above his castle, because he'd felt sudden remorse, and desperately hoped she'd turn back. He was so bitter once the wreckage of her ship had been found, he decreed no foreign person would ever be allowed to disembark in Sabor again.
codex.74b1fe92d01011888f263d705596243d=What Ursulus did not know, was that the princess had survived the terrible voyage. With her remarkable ingenuity she managed to construct a makeshift boat from a sail and beam of the old one. Once returned to the Wahsili, the story of the prince's deception quickly spread, and the Wahsili vowed to rise above the selfishness and cruelty of humankind. The rat clans met in the great burrow beneath the moon, and agreed to a pact of peace. \r\n\r\n\"The Wahsili shall no longer fight over the Lighter of the Lamps. Nor shall they squabble over the prophecies of Envoys, who say the cavern shall shatter. The cavern-beneath-the-cavern hears us, and we must remain humble.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the clans objected to the lack of \"sport\", so it was agreed that the battles themselves should continue, but that no rat should be allowed to come to harm. If you ever chance to visit the burrows in your travels across Foundation, put your ear to the soil, and you may hear the rumble of sword on board, as to this day the rat-people commemorate the return of their princess.

codex.ba56cfc343d729b241c6e1ffe02bc287=14th Kif 3021 \n\nCase summary - The matter regarding the regrettable banishment of former Godhand Parielus in the city of Agbana.\n\nThe incident was so shameful that Parielus will not be celebrated among the pilae of the dead. He won't be received at the gates of Aetherium, or complete his ascent to god.\n\nThe many vulnerable citizens whose residences he broke into shall be compensated with our good wishes and support, and we are certain their experiences will harden them, and better enable their ascent to god.\nThat Parielus abused his position of authority is characteristic of a worrying trend. The case will be put before the assembly.
codex.efc2bff73905626206426c5b6a770abb=29th Kif. Update.\r\n\r\nThis case has been archived. The assembly has declined to discuss it. Premier Telemon believes that incidences of such cases will diminish once we have won the war, and things normalise again. They feel therefore, it is not a matter of precedence.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is now closed, no further Godhands will be questioned, and those involved have been allowed to return to policing. They have of course, been bound to secrecy on the matter. 
codex.a6e6b664950ce6335e942c4be1461ac6=Dear B,\n\nI thought I'd pop this through the door. Cillo has had a wonderful time on holiday in the north country - near Agbana. She said the people outside the city were very poor but they had wonderful fresh produce like keels and ogballs, and that they knew very little of proper living. \n\nAnyway that's not what I wanted to tell you. You wouldn't believe it, but yesterday I took the lift to store fourteen to pick up some stuff, and you'd never believe who I saw there; It was Premier Telemon. Somehow I didn't think him so humdrum as to swap stamps for groceries, but there he was - just like anyone else really, but exceedingly well-washed.\n\nFunny thing is, he had such a nice smile. He even helped me carry my bags from the store, he still finds time to keep himself in shape! I popped him the odd question you know, \"are we really running low on Atlas?\" and he was frank, just said that the assembly was working hard to deal with these issues. He even offered to show me round the assembly rooms, but shyness got the better of me!\n\nSee you at the cloistrum tomorrow afternoon, Phenus will be there strutting his stuff, so you won't want to miss that! Who knows, you two could end up in the Boros! Tee Hee.\n\nViola. x

codex.cb01cc67576b457e3773d7da380fb9c4=At daybreak, I get up and leave the dorm. We little ones are all in there, bunched in rows. The bunks reek of sweat because there's no place to wash. We get so hot during the day - the jackets we wear to mark us out, they are too heavy.\r\n\r\nAt the canteen I gulp my soup, and 'though I am glad of it, I can only think of next morning's soup. I think how hungry I will be this afternoon, how hungry again at night, and that I'll only eat again in the morning if I've done enough.\r\n\r\nI've did enough yesterday, and I get my soup and watch the Goners. I don't want to be a Goner. Goners barely have the strength to beg, and when they are turned away from the kitchen, they shuffle over to your table, and you hang your head, because you know they've picked you. \r\nWhen they reach for your bowl with their scabby hands, you hit them gently, and if they reach again, you hit harder, then harder again, because you need every spoonful for yourself.
codex.8a6036783c4a965afd769efb0b71d5fe=The sign above the canteen is \"through honest labour, earn your place\". Labour means what you do down the mine. I notch my pick every fifty strokes, so that in the darkness, I know my way through the day, I know I've done enough for soup. \r\n\r\nBetween notch forty-three and forty-four an alarm will ring, and we'll be taken to the classroom. The man has a sponge on a stick and mops our faces. We are given books and pens. We sit in the room, which is wonderfully cool. I watch the fan spin before they move my head into position. Then the Godhand takes the photograph. After the classroom, I get between twenty and twenty-two notches more. \r\n\r\nToday we had a visitor. We call him \"Pale Fox\" because he is cunning, and the guards don't see him when he comes to the fence, like a loping fox and he reaches through, and gives us food. We know him by the red serape and when he takes off his mask, his eyes are narrow and kind. He speaks as fast as he can of the uprising, but the Godhands come, so he slips away. All the talk dies then, and it's back to normal.
codex.840e403f4f84e8460766b55cbf3c11c1=Academy schoolbook with notes on \"The Stalk\", by \"Mirik\" in his final year.\n17th Srib, 3039.\n\nFor my Studies\n\nThe Stalk was built about two-hundred and sixty years ago, when Redusa was a lot smaller. Everyone had enough to eat, and no-one got sick. It quickly became the core of our commune, where our ideals of equality and freedom blossomed. Architecturally, the Stalk was an example of what could be done with new and wonderful Atlas. Politically, it was a home to our Committee, the Assembly, and all of the institutions that naturally follow.  \n\nAnyone who has worked there since must have known the secret part, yet the truth never came out until yesterday. Now there can be no question of it, the Stalk is a warship, and the largest ever made. \n\nIt never looked more like a mushroom, than when it floated upward, its roots trailing beneath it, its superfluous office cubicles jettisoning likes spores. It is equipped (they say) with a battery of prohibited weapons, made in the glorious days of advancement, back when we had universities, and scientists actually knew how things worked. 
codex.047a502073064a4ce0e882adc9fb61ed=Our best must be scratching their heads aboard, since no-one has the expertise to know how things work, or what dangers there might be. \r\n\r\nIn all those years the Stalk lay dormant, we have regressed! We have become narcissistic, stupid and destructive. If our ancestors truly were gods, which their trickery makes me doubt, the only thing we have inherited from them is our fear. Fear of the unknown, of what it would be like if we lost our identity, if we lost our name. I tell you, it'd be no great loss compared with the loss of Foundation beneath your feet, like how it is in the Korchis mountains for Mellifluans and Cha-boots. Their history crumbled away into a deep dark hole. Yet our Stalk fights on, because we have to win this war. Well what exactly are we fighting for? Is it only sport we have left?
codex.cea7aca7832297221c756e9b1ad38bb5=For My Master\r\n\r\nWhen you look at my work, and see my mortal words, you'll probably call in the godhands. Then the Godhands will beat me, dispossess me of my book of entitlements, and exile me to the mines with the others. Nevertheless, I refuse to pursue my studies in the conventional way, with everything that is going on around us.\r\n\r\nA true citizen and god would have the right to think for themselves. They would not be a slave to the nonsense which spouts from the Stalk Committee. They would not copy wrote from our textbooks and materials, but fashion their own arguments based upon evidence. The Aetherium does not chaperone and guide me, I guide me. That is what being a God is - I am my only master.
codex.0e5c714d40930e9d55abb74d50414343=At the beginning of the age, Limbo yawned wide, and from its jaws came storms beyond imagination. The twin moons, Sarasella and Moralim, oversaw these changes. This they have done in all past ages; this age being no different. Neither is creator nor destroyer, but by inaction both record and preserve each new world as if it were their first.
codex.8e685dc4f238b7e7c5eac74ee70da069=In the second month, Limbo blew Foundation like a bulb of glass from the darkness, and its crown was covered in ice. Fire warmed the ice, and the water that gushed forth bore long grasses, and mother Methindri as a clam. Methindri chanced to swallow a grass seed passing on the wind, and grew legs and a womb. Then she gave birth to Baliandri, Motus and Shabo, and retired beneath the waves to cry at what she had done.
codex.591b9cd43f34bfe2897905d555b65e37=In the third month, the giant centipede Agonon was formed from the pulp at the bottom of the ocean. He covered himself in scales as defence against the others, who at first desired to eat him. Then he protected himself with volcanoes, which grew from beneath the sea into fiery islands.
codex.2c067da4a1caf7d288c98c0faa0a9704=By the fourth month, Shabo had grown to love Agonon's resourcefulness, and they took pleasure together creating trees and flowers. But Agonon's lust outweighed Shabo's. Alone he created a desert, so that he might bathe himself. It was here he met Baliandri, riding the beetle Motus. Baliandri is both woman and man, kind and unkind, and Agonon began to desire Baliandri. 
codex.2465a65da34aa7d6aec681a79dd743ef=But in the fifth month, when Agonon's many feet rose upon his shining lair, wet with spume from the ocean, and his lover Baliandri rose to the cloud to ingest vapour, and from the breath produce the seeds of all human and animal life, crab-like Shabo came upon her former mate, and fumed at her betrayal.
codex.afdd3f9654c7377f95ff8e086201ca62=Seeing her rage, Agonon said unto his beloved, \"do not punish my infidelity, for you too are fragile of mind, and you too have been Baliandri's companion. Sentiment must not lead us, or we will be brought to destruction.\"\nShabo replieth, \"Yes, Agonon, but love prevails over frivolous desire. Be assured I shall have my vengeance upon thee.\"

Every day someone makes a break for it - better to die trying than not try at all.\n\nScratching Atlas did it - it's in the air down here. If there were ten of of us, nine would be dead. Of those nine, seven had the sickness. \nGoners went blue, their skin blistered, they choked.     \nBut I've not got it. I'm just glad I've not got it.\n\nYou'll be leaving soon, now that we're spent. \nWell, I tell you, it's no relief at all. Is the dead mouse relieved, when the cat lets its dead body alone?\n\nYou'll tell us to pack and go home. \nBut we've got no home, Darat is fallen. \n \nLower us down a new shaft, and we'll scratch it with the puny tools you've given us. And the Goners will get the sickness, and we'll mourn them. As long as we do your work, we can pity you. If you leave, we won't even have that.\n\nAnd the penitents still wash by the riverbank. Shame on them. Shame on their shame.

I don't like fighting, I like making. I like making best. \n\nI found some trees and I cut them and stuck them up. They call it a prow.\n\nI do it again, and again. War hurts, so I won't be fighting in the war, but I will be making.\n\nJJ (Written very crudely, which suggests all but the signature is a dictation)

We had the heaviest clothing and the headiest confusion up there. It was hard to have to report it, but the closer we got to little moon, the further away it felt. \n\nEven with the apparatus, we couldn't breathe, and our ears stoppered, and the little green ball didn't seem any nearer. Aetherium guide us, it was fearful.\n\nThey could try sending the skyhulks up, but then a remote signal can only travel so far. \n\nLittle moon remains an enigma, as it has always been. I wonder if some things are best left unexplained. It's not the answer, but the question, that gives us meaning. \n\nJust suppose that glow is not Atlas, but Aetherium, waiting to absorb us. In a way I'm happier not to be sure.\n\nWe are god.

codex.6bd86274aac79e985ed7310a50dd5c79=Dad told us about the Stone War. Said the ships were a thousand deep, and that not even a \"Pinnish firework festival\" could compare to the spectacle of that last battle. I asked him about the old world every night. He said he couldn't tell us about Foundation, it would appear to us \"a dream so beautiful\", the stories would drive us mad, and we'd not be able to go on living. But we survived on those stories, me and Tressa. \r\n\r\nSome nights he couldn't help but let his secrets slip. He spoke of ripe fruit, that the trees of Sabor were heavy with juicy pippins and nanban. \r\n\r\n\"One day there might be an island with fruit on the tree, then we'll know it used to be part of Sabor. But it's more like Tarrery here, that icy wind, that whale meat. \" \r\n\r\n\"Fruit can't taste better than whale, can it?,\" I'd say, and then we'd laugh.\r\n \r\nI remember once we saw an island covered in lights. Dad swore it must be Momoros, but when we drew near it was a tower infested with luminous worms. \r\nI couldn't stop Dad crying. He kept saying that no city would ever be built like Momoros again.

Sabor was perfection. We grew full of ourselves, chests fit to burst. Now all is gone below.\"\r\n\"How did it go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows. But first it was the cities that fell. Then Shabo fell and the oceans poured away, and every other thing followed like a yanked tablecloth. The earth crumbled, dry and brittle, in great scars - city-swallowers they were.

codex.193f0ef193c9fc801fedc2f56c540b73=Stalk Committee Flyer, 3026\nThree years ago, I argued that we needed to look outside our own country if we were to meet the challenges of the third millennium.\n\nThough I still believe that, I look at Redusa and it stirs my pride. I see the happy swimmers at the cloistrum, and the beauty of the delta. There is nothing we do not have that is worth having. It is this committee's aim to keep it that way.\n\nWe regret what has happened in Bandinia, despite reasons we may have for being less charitable towards them. But what's done is done. We move on for the better.\n\nThat is why we have decided to support the Mellifluans in their war against their neighbours Chabuti. This means more of our men and women will be heading to the Korchis mountains to bolster our allies. They join a fine cause, which will bring them close to god.  \n\nWe are gods.   \n\n<some scrawl is written over the flyer that reads \"Nonsense, we're fighting for Atlas!\">
codex.a6c2f2bb91286c7bf5b062998b5d1a1c=Stalk Committee Flyer, 3027\nWe knew that the Mellifluans would let us down, but looking ahead, it leaves the future very much in our hands. Sometimes that means making tough decisions, or hearing arguments we don't want to hear. \n\nWe are a proudly independent nation, and we intend to remain that way. In the past we have stayed out of Foundation matters, and that has suited us well. But times change, and we need to make concessions and sacrifices, such as sending our brave men and women to Melliflua. It's important that they expropriate the munitions, skyships and structures that we so generously provided before the alliance was breached.  \n\nThe Mellifluans are a people who will stop at nothing to take, take and take again. They made peace with Chabuti because they received a better offer from the Unity, and we've learned a lesson or two about trust. \n\nWhat we know now is that these nations are jealous of us. They hate our noble deeds, they hate our happiness - a wealth that is beyond gold. We must show them how wrong they are.\n\nWe are gods.
codex.236bcb5fcfa6538673d09b16fef78803=Stalk Committee Flyer, 3028\nTo the Saborian people I say this - The Stalk Committee speaks from the Aetherium. We are among gods, and have the backing and support of your ancestors. Telemon has risen, but now he commands us from above.\n\nImagine living in Ten-Rui, think what they must be going through. Know that though we've made a bold choice, we think it's the right choice. If we want Atlas, we need to go to Melliflua and get it. Mining our own countryside is a desperate measure we don't need to take, so put down your picks and listen up. It's up to each citizen to understand that by doing that, we conflict with the values we hold so dear, and are no longer gods.\n\nSince the conflict began in Melliflua, we have not lost, only gained. Yes, some of us have departed to Aetherium, but they speak with us now when we say keep pushing. Keep pushing and Melliflua will back down, and a whole new land of opportunity will open up.\n\nWe are god.
codex.51b3af96157837a124577d1971aa742b=Stalk Committee Flyer, 3029 \n\nCongratulations Saborians, this is a time of celebration. Take your book of entitlement to any storekeeper, and receive a free item of your choice from the selection.\n\nThere will be a victory parade tomorrow afternoon at Redusa pleasure gardens, and a speech by Admiral Methusan, a god among us. He will announce that, out of very positive negotiations with the Gall come new deals on technology. In particular the provision of fifty Sky Hulks that will render any retaliation by the Kioki trivial. \n\nRegrettably many of your loved ones must remain in Melliflua for the foreseeable future. But by preserving order, and keenly mining Atlas, they bring us a step closer to god. Sabor will have her golden days again.\n\nFreedom, Equality, We are god!
codex.9e31aa0c041e12f29bab015323a7d065=Stalk Committee Flyer, 3031\n\nAt the heart of a Saborian, is not material wealth, but our determination to live the ideal life, and live it as equals. \n\nThis is why it is important, in uncertain times, to turn to those who have the difficult decisions to make, and to understand why they say the things they do.\n\nWhat we are asking is that you take any wanton Atlas items to the amnesty in your city centre, to help give our troops a fighting chance. We are doing well, but we could be doing so much better with your help. Just remember, when the war ends, you'll get everything back and more.\n\nAs we speak, more mines are opening up all over Melliflua, we just need a small loan to get the tools and equipment we need to dig deeper and faster, and get ourselves back on track.\n\nWar is temporary, our future is permanent. Freedom, Equality, We are god!
codex.468c6051a84decb4b0119f43e8927929=Stalk Committee Flyer, 3034\nThis is it. The time has come to live up to our promises. We told you we'd win the war, and looking at the facts, we've made positive strides towards that end.\n\nA lot of you have been asking about the effectiveness of the Sky Hulks. Well, you're right to ask. We admit, things haven't been good enough, but there are redrafts on the table, and we'll be looking very closely at the technical side with our Gallish friends.\n\nWe are gods.
codex.908edb6d81e44c65bcc13f2827cb39fc=Stalk Committee Flyer, 3038\n\nMelliflua is gone, it is true. All that remains is the sea, flowing gently downward at the place they call Ocean's fall. It is a beautiful memorial to those that mined for us, who lived as citizens and rose as gods. \n\nSabor is the bough of heaven. The quakes are merely the tremors from elsewhere, rippling gently towards us. Have no doubt that Sabor shall hold firm, even if all else crumbles.\n\nWe are gods.
codex.426f2327b3422c0c5c4841cb8430bd95=Stalk Committee Flyer, 3039\nThere have been accusations, there have been demonstrations. But in uncertain times, it's important that we stick together. Great Epilomelos, when faced with heavy odds sought to unite his people, not divide them. \n\nAs a statement of our commitment to the cause, we reveal today the true function of the Stalk - the best kept secret we have. The Stalk is a ship. She is the greatest ever built. We never thought we'd see her on the front line, but if ever there was a time, that time is now. Today we cut loose the chock buttresses, and tomorrow she takes to the air.\n\nShe will join the vast flotilla, heralding the definitive encounter in our history.\nWe must. Strike. Now. \n\nWomen, children, Pilipai, join us. If you have any sort of ship, jump aboard and help us defeat the Kioki once and for all. It will be an epic battle, a great rising. We set off at dawn, and rendezvous with the fleet over Ocean's fall.\n  \nWe shall rise. We are gods.

One peek 'neath the canvas at my properties, and I'd have been up and at him, knife to his wizendy throat. \r\n\r\nBut it ain't like that here in Capulca, not at all.

We were given to following any advice the old men had, so I followed in behind him. We went into the wet dark at speed.

Understand them. Respect them,\" he said. I guess that's what he meant for me to see - this strange new kingdom of critters. But why did it have to be in the middle of night!?

As to these troubles you mention - you refer to the Pilipai, I presume?\" \n\nScribe Barius: (wearily) \"Without the Pilipai there would be nothing, and the Pilipai do nothing but serve us, Premier.\"\n\nPremier Telemon: \"Serve us? Precisely Barius, precisely.\"\n\n(Laughter rises to the rafters of the chamber, and Barius sinks into his chair)

The other hand hovered above the red button. Then I pressed it. I held his gaze as I spoke.\n\n\"We are gods.\"\n\nI heard the fragile echo from the loudspeaker. My voice sounded strained. Telemon grimaced. I cleared my throat before continuing.\n\n\"I know many of you listening, both here in Redusa and in the other great cities, have been hearing scurrilous rumours. Defamations of the worst kind...\"\n\nTelemon nodded encouragement. I saw now he meant to stay until the end. He didn't know I was thinking of wrecking him.\n\n\"...well, there is truth in those rumours.\"\n\nI paused for a long time. Telemon waved his hands to urge me on. Now would be the perfect moment.\n\n\"The truth is that.. Premier Telemon is indeed past the age of ascension. But, do not worry. No crime has been committed, no ungodly deception conceived.\"   \n\nTelemon smiled his smug smile, I hadn't let him down. I wondered what it was that made me lie for him. Surely the people will see through this charade.

A stone which confirms all that we have thought about the Aetherium. It is through this stone, that Sabor has in fact been governed, since the days of our greatest leader Epilomelos.\"\r\n\r\nMethusan appeared at the door, and Telemon gave him a signal to say that all was going well. Methusan crept cheekily to the library chair and sat on it. He winked at me.\r\n\r\n\"In line with my duties as the secretary's secretary, I hereby put myself forward as a conduit through which we make a direct connection with Aetherium.

He wishes you all well, and hopes you understand that it was necessary to keep this fact from you until the appropriate time. He adds, that Aetherium is all you dreamt it would be, and more - and that it is of utmost importance that things remain just as they have always been. There will be further announcements shortly. In the meantime, there is no reason to panic, please return to your homes and your assignments. All will be well. We are god.\"\r\n\r\nAs I finished, I knew why I had done it.

We anticipate you choosing Dawnfire as ever, and the team have already set to work on the remaining parts.\n\nOn the matter of our Sky Hulks, they have disappointed me as much they have you.\nThe foreman tells me it has been difficult getting the necessary Gallish co-operation.

codex.4ab94b1c5861ff9c6ee9f1510cd11ab8=The inner Court of the Empress. Many have pondered what stirs within those emerald and be-sparrowed walls. Well, fortune had it that, twenty years ago, I found out firsthand. I'm not supposed to talk about it of course, but I'm an old guy, what can they do? \r\nI was asked there by a Nabob in the Atlas business. I sensed his invitation was extended to me solely as a show of power and influence. Nevertheless, I cordially accepted - it was exciting! - and in the preceding weeks I underwent examinations both of my mind and of my business, before I was finally accredited. When the day came, I donned a fine viridian tunic, presented the Empress' seal I had been given, and joined the solemn procession past the hectic trade bourse, and in beneath the arch. \r\n\r\nMy friend the Nabob manages a brief conspiratorial smile as we take in the wonder of the gardens - how had I, from such a lowly family, wangled myself in here? The impossible sculptures I had seen from above were even more impressive close-up. Ripe cradles of fruit, delicate meats and fine wines are tabled all the way up to the doors. It is strange to see unfamiliar men and women, picnicking at leisure on the scorched grass. At the Warlock's chalk circle there is a heated argument, and the sparrow guard watch on impassively. \r\nI feel a swell of pride when we have eaten, and the procession resumes, and makes to enter the holy chamber itself. Green petals scattered, the scent of sweet and heavy Bourgeon oil burning to vapour, I feel as if I am still there now. Though never an ardent imperial, I can't help but be swept up in the splendour.
codex.787684e7fd76292899fed2b6b34ef149=We encircle the holy dais. Copper-cast bells shaped like animals hang to one side from a wooden frame, there is a sparrow, a long-eared mouse, and a long-neck - one for each state of the Unity. They are struck sharply with a metal rod. At the resulting clamour, the Warlock appears, his white locks swaying stiffly. The whole thing is like an illusion. He is carrying the sceptre of investiture in his hands, and I can only see the bulging whites of his eyes beneath the great Pinnish fur hat he insists on wearing. He must be dripping with sweat. Then there is a collapse all around me, and I realise I'm expected to kneel.   \r\n\r\nOnce the Warlock is seated on the middle throne, the court stands again. There is a whistle of woodwind, and some scrambled riffery on the Pati-Pikk from the court musicians. Then the Empress gaily enters. They say she is courting suitors, for she must soon sire the first of her eight daughters. Her attendants fuss about her, but she bats them away. Her long dress seems a mismatch for her skipping gait. She is smiling, she is beautiful, I can see she neither likes nor dislikes the attention, it is simply routine. It is rare to witness such a moment as this - when the Empress is young, unburdened by children.
codex.61f4470c0dfb32ec105ffc373b81e63e=Many of the mercantile authority now lie touching the floor. Respectfully, I too enter a deeper stoop, but cannot help but maintain my gaze upon her dark and flawless face. She takes time to begin a circuit of the room, kneeling, squatting, sitting haphazardly to greet her acolytes. As she reaches me, I lower my head, \"Hello,\" I hear her whisper warmly, then she moves on. When her greetings are over, she takes to the leftmost chair on the dais, and the animal bells are rung once again. \r\n\r\nThe rightmost chair is tiny and empty - I am told the seat is symbolic, reserved for the Elder of the Pin, should he ever wish to travel from Huacanado and assist with the running of the court. The Empress beckons the head of the Mercantile Authority, Nabob Juliata. He takes to the floor and reads from the holy book of the Empress, the Book of Soil.
codex.92cd15df48e5f6679935cc74e7500c8d=\"And then the Book of Soil was opened, and from it the first Empress did emerge like a jewel. She curled up from the paper that burned, growing smoother and smoother until she was whole. She bends and sways and gnashes her teeth, and her muscles pulse with the fire that smokes her limbs. Then the wise men said \"the Empress is born, Ishgiru is born,\" and all delighted in the new arrival, and gave her instructions on how to govern, what rules to make. She was a wonderful listener, and she heard their pleas, and she did as she was told.\"\n\nThen the Nabob replaces the holy book on its ivory stand, and opens the gold  emerald reliquary, which is cast with the face of the Empress. He anoints the cheeks of the Empress, then the Warlock, with the balm inside. The floor is then opened to questions, to which the Empress and her Warlock respond.
codex.90703ff01c374a206672f4c9c90e737e=There was a general sense of optimism around that court, that I cannot imagine exists now. It was a golden age, and all anyone would talk of was Atlas. I myself had a few words to say on the subject, in particular the new and improved skyship engines we had constructed, and of the many boviaries making fuel in Karem.\r\n\r\nThe court session lasted for six hours. Afterward we returned to the grass for evening banquet. It was excessive privilege. I felt like a traitor to the people I worked with each day, who struggled to get by. The people of the low-town. Make no mistake, there were just as many suffering back then, as there are now. It was just that they had no voice, they didn't complain, it was simply the way things were. \r\n\r\nWhen it was time to leave, I rejoined the street, stopping only a moment to look in through the railings at the beautiful schoolhouse, which towered high above. When the bell of the Crested Ptarmigan tolled, the many sons and daughters of the Empress' family spilled out. They were her blood kin, her many cousins, nephews, nieces. They may never rule in name, but the children I saw that day are today's Nabobs, holding purse over all others. The gilded tentacles of the court, that reach down, and wrap around the beating heart of the city.

I mean they do have some great technical attributes, but none are self-taught like me. They embrace the rigid frameworks that everyone needs to learn, but lack the flair to extend beyond them.\"\r\n\r\nElswin will be performing a new epic \"Life's red fabric\" aboard the Frillship Bellowes on her tour of Melliflua between 1st and 22nd of Kif.

codex.bf05cdbf4198a8ce0a66789dc9a8c6d1=When I received the news from the Employment sub-committee, I admit I was disappointed. Shame on me for betraying my godhood, but I'd hoped to be an Essedari soldier, so I could fly the world. As it turned out, the letter informed me that I would shortly be assigned to a research position. I was going to become a student. \r\n\r\nI had visions of dingy libraries and austere silences. I saw myself leafing through dusty tomes, as love and summer passed me by. On top of that, the University was in Redusa, which meant I would probably have to move home. It was with anxiety then, that I took my letter to the employment office.\r\n\r\n\"You have been assigned to...\" \r\n\r\nI held my breath.\r\n\r\n\"...the University annexe, here in Agbana. Nature conservation. You will assist with the interpretation of animal behaviours, and help towards a better understanding of the habitats in which they live.\"\r\n\r\nWell, this was a surprise. I was pleased, at least, that I would not be leaving Agbana. But as to the work, I had little or no knowledge of the animal kingdom at that time, and did not know what to think.
codex.53557aa794be4038aa9e9d4f2c4069cf=Our new cohort was sent out with a tutor, Pater, who had been at the ministry for three years. We were expecting a trip into the wilderness. To our surprise, we were taken no more than fifty metres, to a scree slope I had seen, but seldom paid much notice. Now I saw that the square had been built around it, and that it was covered in beautiful jasmine flowers. \r\n\r\n\"Please, please, please, do not harm any of the creatures you see,\" Pater said grimly, \"nor should you take it upon yourself to come to their aid, since you may inadvertently damage the delicate balance that exists, even in such a mundane place as this.\"  \r\n\r\nWhat he wished to bring to our attention, was the life cycle of a colony of ants. \r\n\r\n\"See how each ant fulfils duties they are stuck with from birth. They have no choice, yet they bear such responsibility implicitly. See how this one strides boldly under the eyes of its predators, so certain is he in the system he is part of.\"
codex.6efbf92c0555fbd11863b4cf5a63e258=It was intriguing to see so many facets of our own lives mirrored in the meanderings of this unseen community. Of course, the lives of the ants seemed a lot less pleasurable than our own. A blue lizard appeared, for example, and ate several ants with a single flick of tongue. The hive turned on the lizard, and managed to drive him away, swarming over him, and biting through his loose and wrinkled skin. \r\n\r\n\"This is exactly the kind of example we provide to the schools,\" Pater continued. \"The lesson you should learn from today, is that no matter your prior experience, there is a project to reach out to you, and consume you.\"\r\n\r\nI was rather taken with the ants, myself. In them I saw the things I had craved from a military career. A sense of purpose, of belonging, and of good organisation. But then I also came to see things I was glad to have passed up. None of the ants had any steer of their own beyond immediate threats to the wellbeing of their nest. I imagined soldiery to be similar. Although presently there was little to occupy our armies, who could say what the future held?

codex.514fc28505a198f3f7509ab49727da5f=What a remarkable sight, as the fire of summer is not yet roaring, and the sun is an enriching egg. On Ten-Rui's streets a great fanfare blows, and blossom falls, and the floats pass by for each of the champions. The pageant begins with Nabob Trelown's shoemakers. Then the cheesemakers - Nabob Kadogbia sitting upon a great girdle of cheese, slicing through a palmful of soured purse with his teeth, then flapping his arms to the cheers like a turkey. \r\n\r\nHis Champion is Arabilla, a young woman of bounce. She is a stilt-master, and a vicious fighter. She bears the scars of last year's race across her side - a lancing, which though she survived, knocked her off her stilts and cost her the race. Her bester was the Schoolmasters' guildsman, Zuberi Tato. Tato may have sealed second place, but he did not survive the injury Arabilla's dagger did him as she fell. \r\n\r\nThis year, the Schoolmasters have not named a successor. Absence from the stilt race would be an embarrassment to their Nabob, who is close enough to the prickly old Empress to stir her temper if he failed to find a suitable champion. After all, the School of the Crested Ptarmigan is a stone's throw from the court, and the whole imperial lineage was taught there.
codex.8106d629d18c40d3efcc943cd79e42dc=Once the pageant has ended, the competitors take to the starting line. The Empress Dinoue appears at the top of the hill in a palanquin the size of a small building. Her trusty guardian, the Warlock of the Dragon-Dog stands beside her, his eyes eager for violence. The crowd below is as tumultuous as ever - the largest section of support being for the quarrymen, thanks to the great industry which is Atlas. Even rat-men from the Wahsili have made it to the spectacle, and  all intention of continuing with the daily routine has subsided for these three days. \r\n\r\nTipped for victory is the Selenite Obo. For it is in north Ishgiru, in the broad steppe, that stilts were first used to navigate across streams and rivers. Obo is a young man, both hardy and fast, the champion of the moon-lover Selenites. Their frugal float passed by with a whimper, only a small caravan of trainers and aides following a humble display of wooden mobiles - the small and large moons of our heavens. But Obo has prepared well, he has a good chance.
codex.06a38423e26ee6ad1f2fafdff03229da=The speckled serpent that haunts me. It feels real when I touch it, but then it breaks into a thousand tiny spiders, who scuttle away to the corners of my dream. Every night the dreams grow stronger, the jungle denser, and I wrestle the dangling vines as if they are real. \r\n\r\nI am settled now. I feel better. The cup of vittles is helping. But wait! Perhaps there is there something in the water? \r\nI throw the vittles to the ground. \r\n\r\nIt started when we first visited Broad River, where the Pekoe say the most magnificent Atlas boulder was found. Just like the dreams, the trees are close and the air is sticky. We went to the old huts which served the Pekoe, before the Nabob Lammon Lammon built his Hospital. \r\n\r\nI remember being drawn to it the moment I walked through the door of the hut. The hooded Twy-Ni-Banda, a mask of the snake-men of the western jungle. Ever since the serpent has stuck in my mind. 
codex.91a3f88e94a9af8e5b73be189491828e=Last night was the worst of it. I saw a mirror of the mask, slick, scaled, its eyes without emotion. Then it came to life, striking at me with its curved fangs. In these dreams it is as if I am tied down, unable to move, and the snake strikes me relentlessly until I am dead.\r\n\r\nI have remained indoors for several days. I will not go into the trees, for fear of seeing them, those little coils of rope that may unwind at any moment.\r\n\r\nIt does not help me that the Pekoe persist with these masks. I would prefer if I could see their faces, to know how they react to what I do. Do they like me? Am I going about my work and study well? I confess I have no understanding, or desire to understand, their obsession with Atlas as a medical tool. I see no benefit in holding stone above a man's head until he becomes bored at the sight of it. I argue with them, but I cannot dispute the results.
codex.70bf37d76541074b19a67a7b0e107927=I saw a real snake on the grass. I put my hand over my mouth so as to stifle my scream. The snake seemed scared. I stepped away from it and went quickly inside. \r\n\r\nIt was a vile thing, but not nearly as frightening as the mask I saw. It is a relief to have finally seen one.\r\n\r\nMy dreams have subsided, but I had another episode last night. Though the creatures and the masks were there, I am learning to contend with them. Soon I will tug the fabric of the dreamworld my way, become its master again. The masks will fall and I'll see the faces behind them.

Imhorta bleeds from the wounds they make, blood runs from the gash in her leg. We can do nothing for her, and she says to us;\r\n\r\n\"My children, I am not immortal. Like you, I must one day die.

Mellifluan theatre is really the most tedious, gaseous and laboured of all art forms. The fact that these performers are paid in currency for their shambolic attempts at replicating the dreary everyday miseries of Mellifluans rankles as much as anything else. Not to mention the suffocating ubiquity of those wretched beetle-blood loin cloths they drape everywhere. Every set design seems to be the same; mountains and mountains of that stupefying cloth.\n\nIn fact the only thing I can recommend that isn't bettered in our own productions is the curious use of animals. There was one particular play in which this produced some very entertaining moments. Yes, \"Mo\" as he is known by the crowds, is a donkey with the most remarkable stage presence. \n\nThey say it's more the things he doesn't do, than the things he does. His performances were just so effortless, so natural. You may not be familiar with \"Rethinga,\" the classic Melliflaun drama, but the original play casts a horse in the role. I'm not sure if they were short of horses, but I'm of the opinion that the donkey was a better casting decision. Frankly the whole point is that the Queen's chosen lover is more modest and humble than the other suitors, so where a horse might seem a little aloof, a donkey is perfect.\n\nThe depravity of the Mellifluans knows no bounds, but suffice to say this donkey \"Mo\" put a lot of relish into the wedding scenes, and it paid off handsomely. Rightly or wrongly the scene had the audience in fits.

codex.91af77aaf2149d6ce6bd6f5ed3d424f5=The Tower of Nabobs is an eyesore - a shallow assimilation of Gallish geometric principles. No expense has been spared in making it sparkle, but to flatter its designers would be to miss that the \"marvel\" rotary colonnade is nothing but a gaudy copy.   \r\n\r\nIf you visit the Hall of Posterity at the University of Panyana, you will see the original design upon an immaculately preserved ninth-century fresco where all seventeen of the Gallish deities can be seen. But that is not all. Their significance goes far beyond the calendar, since the artist Arei-Do-Kwin was at pains to reconcile his representations of the gods with their natures.
codex.80c8e261746b80b448da8cc14261ffcb=Forced to visit this Tower of Nabobs when contending the egregious pricing of the pigment purple, I was unsurprised to discover that the Nabobs, who are borne preposterously about in palanquins, live lives of gluttonous excess. They are heavy with perfume, wine and game meats, and the footmen who bear their boxes often collapse from exhaustion.  \r\n\r\nIt is less a place of business, more of seedy entertainments. It commences with the greeting at the threshold from the Warlock of Bliss. He hands out novelties to the guests, some intoxicants. I decline. Immediately I am confronted by the sight of bared buttocks. I cannot speak of what transpires in that cubicle, under the sign of Cob, because I do not hang around long enough to find out. \r\n\r\nUnpleasantness is a constant threat. In one room under the images of Babbo, where a discussion is taking place in regard to an upstart trader of amphibians from Great Marsha, four nabobs are feasting on a surfeit of live spindle-fins. The fishes flop and jerk unnaturally on their gilded serving platters.
codex.a178221293841791a2d719d837a3d1f0=These Nabobs are supposed to be the figureheads of their guilds, bringing light to the lives of the shoemakers and the quarrymen, but instead they loaf on long chairs, eating cooked gilded hare, dog and goose. I even saw a criminal and a Vinicotian compete in a fighting pit for the pleasure of a small crowd - the cannibal won, and took the body of his opponent home as a prize.\r\nTo think that the Empress Datta-Menatatifi III, to whom these nabobs are all blood relations, condones such vile behaviour. Although I suppose it is likely she has never come to know the true extent of the depravity, since she rarely leaves court. 
codex.9a35cdcd9d93d4763cf9661916e8b02a=REPORT: To the Stalk Committee, Qang 2797.\n\nSUBJECT: Visit to the Ten-Rui Trade Bourse.\n\nDEFINITION: The Kioki Bourse in Ten-Rui is an exchange system for stock. People of all hues gather to barter upon the rise and fall of individual commodities, or groups of them. \n\nDESCRIPTION: The Bourse is situated within the grand gardens of the Empress' palace, not far from the private school known as \"The Crested Ptarmigan\". These schoolchildren will grow up to become the Nabobs and Merchants that swell the halls of the Bourse, members of trade societies that revel in wine, bloating their bodies beyond imagination.\n\nPersonal permission from long-serving Empress Melina is required to become a stockholder or broker. To my astonishment, I, a Saborian, was perfectly able to obtain this, needing only to raise an initial sum of capital (which I generated by trading the Saborian produce kindly donated for this experiment). I was reliably informed that there are pure-blood Ishgiruans who are denied such a right, only because they cannot afford it! Such an arbitrary entry condition means that there is no guarantee of noble character among traders... 
codex.02617700663dabf00c97efc3977cc01c=...It was stuffed full, the Bourse. Yet it is my opinion that the betting (essentially an accepted system of gambles. While the average Ishgiruan will bet on the stilt races, they aren't as familiar with the potential of the Bourse) is heavily weighted in favour of those that already have wealth to begin with. This is only exaggerated by the meddling of its arbiters - the so-called Mercantile Authority - who seem to pass information to their favourites in advance of shifts in the market. \n\nOnce the bidding commenced for the day, there was a tumultuous conflux of screaming traders, very rough indeed, and I was unable to place any bids at all. Such a system encourages the weak of body to become disillusioned. Imagine how our half-aetherials would fit into such a system? I think of my sister, who is deaf. This \"system\" of shouting and pushing does not accommodate her.\n\nFINDINGS: The Bourse is a layer of greed atop a layer of greed. It serves only to stratify their society further. Such a system is in complete conflict with our ideals, and would by its very existence and use of currency, create poverty and inequality. Theirs is a society that is driven by nothing but the pursuit of wealth. If we wish to preserve our godhood, we must ignore shallow ways. These Ishgiruans are not gods, they are mortals whose hands and souls are corroded by metal.

He insisted I return with him to his country and treat his children. \n\nWhy did I go to Sabor?\nI was too curious about the way the complaint had broken out upon their skin, I had to know more.\n\nWhat does it matter?\nWhen I arrived, I almost forgot myself. I didn't think a city could be anything but ugly, crudely hewn, an insult to Meth. But I was wrong. All I could think on were the wonders I saw. \n\nWhy so wondrous?\nIt was natural. Its creators must channel Meth's spirit. The city is clean and sharp like a flint, but clear like water and blends like the leaf-insect.  \n\nWhat did I see?\nFilled with joy, I longed to wander among the towers. He gripped me by the arm, and said I must not get lost. I saw gardens of delight, hot pools and fountains, and the beautiful bathers. Their bodies were healthy, and I delight in cleanliness.\n\nWhat else?\nThe other parts, that are man-made, they are sheer-built with brick as the sand cliffs all around. There are bronze caskets of metal that raise us up with a whirr, so that we may be among the arches and domes, and a skyline that spins many loops before it breaks.   \n   \nBut what of the complaint?\nThe skin complaint was mild, but they feared the worst. The father comforted the young daughter, who had been many weeks alone in his absence. I used the stone I had brought with me, and assured her she would be free of the complaint within a moon. She was afraid of my doctor's mask, and asked after it. I said it separated me from myself.\n\nWhat did I gain by it?\nI gained the friendship of the girls and their father. They believe greatly in helping one another, and I was glad to be able to help them. They presented me a hat made of duck feathers, and regretted they could not give me more. I know now, Sabor is the most noble place.

Was this the cruel and savage land to which we had been sent? We took our ship Redusa at a run towards the godforsaken cove, and huddled in their long lined coats, but it was scarcely enough to dissuade the wind and the spittle of the sea from biting. \n\n\"Beautiful Sabor, will we ever see her again, the crescent of her bounty?\" said the bo'son.\n\"There's nothing to keep us here, let us turn back,\" said another.\n\"Please captain, let us. It is plain from the jaggedy rocks, and the fickle wind that there is nothing for us here.\"\n\"We must stay true to our quest, and buck this homesickness like a yak its fleas,\" I said as boldly as I could, yet at heart I was with my companions.\n
codex.7d00fff86f9f652e0b03fae4ea3919e1=Having dragged the longship Redusa ashore, we struck out over the cliffs, to the top of a long moor. Nearby was a bleak settlement that we hoped might accommodate us. Their houses were elegant, though too strange to afford us comfort. A local woman saw that we were soldiers, and gestured for us to lay down our weapons. Their faces were pale, and their eyes slender and curved.\n\nHer husband, emerging from their dwelling and passing an infant to his wife (They had agreed to suffer each others' company for life), knew us to be Saborian, and began to practice his illiterate version of our language without any invitation. All the while the wind buffeted and snapped among us, and we were desperate for hot food and shelter. 
codex.a97b3f4a9c098581fab97c4ac516169a=\"I'm sorry,\" he realised, \"you must be cold. Come inside.\"\r\nHe ushered us to the most prominent of the buildings. It stood vulgar and proud from the ordinary houses, and a great red banner flew above it. With uncertainty, we laid our arms at the door, and were at the disposal of the folk inside. \r\n\r\n\"Why do you come?\" relayed the man conversant in our language, after a short discussion with his peers.\r\n\"We were sent. What can we learn?\"\r\nThe translator sniggered, and when he told his friends my reply, they fell about. I shifted uncomfortably in the straw seat. \r\n\"Oh!\" The man howled, water streaming from his eyes. \"We are House of the Gullet\".\r\n\"Gullet?\" I said. \r\nHe tapped the pear-shaped alcove between his collarbones. \r\n\"Oh,\" I said, beleaguered by how strange they were.
codex.082a81a1f7dc0503efa87dcea80b0e46=They offered us wine and ham, but the wine was sour and the ham was salty. Watching our hosts eat was very hard. They had a deliberate way of swallowing, which once I'd noticed it, became increasingly bothersome. There were mutterings among the men that we had done what was asked by making contact, and that it must now be time to return to our ship Redusa. I agreed, and rose to my feet. \n\"But wait,\" our translator said, \"you must meet the Father of Gullet.\"\nSo we waited there in the squalor, sharing the hall with strung pheasants, vomit-strewn tables, and the dark friezes of intermingled limbs that hung on the walls. The Gullets stared at us, sometimes erupting in nitwit giggles.
codex.18886327c14d64496ef3aa2a19dcee9b=When Father of Gullet did arrive, he was clad in finery that is the venal corruption of foreign-kind. \r\n\"Do you own this land?\" I asked, anticipating a boast. \r\n\"Yes,\" he said, then swallowed three times, provoking a peculiar frisson of excitement among his kin. \r\n\"How far does your kingdom reach?\" I said, remembering we had been asked to discover the island's size.\r\n\"My part, or the whole body?\" \r\n\"Do you not own it all?\"\r\nMore laughter.\r\n\"We are House of the Gullet, and will fight and dispute our corner, but in the whole, must admit we are only a small part.\"\r\n\"Then there are other houses?\"\r\n\"Yes. Too many to count. The largest is Verduba, House of Ice.\" \r\n\"And they have no sovereignty?\"\r\n\"Only over themselves.\"\r\n\"If there so many clans, don't you squabble and fight over lands and monies?\"\r\n\"Yes. But there are so many Houses and estates, that the battles are always small, and the casualties few.\"\r\nAfter the serious matter of politics had been set aside, the evening grew stranger yet. In the freezing night they lit a dirty fire of all the wood they had at hand, and undressing entirely, began to dance around it and call out harshly. We were told this was how the spirit of the humankind was invoked, but it sent many of my men back to our ship early in fear.
codex.c80cbdf29801e7f2bf2e43dde4e37842=I remained, as here there was a commonality; a love of the healthy body. It was not however, muscular buttocks, full breasts and broad shoulders they admired, but the miscellany of other lesser-known parts that could never be loved, such as the tiniest bones of the ears, or the mysterious appendix.\n\nIn the morning we thanked the Gullets quickly and made our way. In conclusion, we were pleased to discover at least, that these Verdubans have a general desire to see things rightly done, though are earnest to the point of causing annoyance.  \n\nFinally we were back aboard the Redusa, sailing for home, and my companions were joyful indeed. In the round, it would be two months at sea for a day's exploration, but we agreed that was plenty enough.
codex.785e3d0c6f70c719b56bc899e70a1417=My skin felt so soft and supple, it was lovely! Still, when asked if I wanted my back doing, I must have turned scarlet. But I nodded, I didn't want to miss a part of the ritual. Under the cloche, the mud bubbled up from the thermal reserve. It took a brave hand to scoop it out, and when it hit my skin, I yelped. But it soon cooled, and I felt the bubbles tickle. The masseur said the bubbles were so delicate because of the pumice layer. And afterward, wow! I've never felt so clean.\r\n\r\nWhen I eventually stepped outside, a pair of chickens surged past and flapped around the other bathers. This was the perfect distraction, and I took my chance to leap into the ice pool before the others could catch a glimpse. I couldn't remain in the ice water long, and so upped and dried myself in the steamless hot room. It was there that the Verdubans passed around a smoking pipe made of brass, like our kraken horns, which scented our bodies with sweet camphor and balsam. 
codex.3b355a8e42f2cd92416d9f954e742edd=<an article in \"The Horticulturist\" a Mellifluan magazine>\n\nAlthough it is true that the Verdubans have a preoccupation with the human body, and particularly its more base functions, it is an outright myth that Verdubans always walk around naked. To do this in their chill climate would be absurd. Indeed, their ritual only occurs (if you exclude the mud bath-houses and attendances at public theatre, which are always conducted nude) once a year. \n\nThis is event is festival week, held in honour of the Ice God. Though the exact date varies, it is always held around the summer equinox, where there is almost no darkness at all. Nudity is both more comfortable on hot summer days, and apart from anything else, is an outward celebration of freedom, not some insular perversion. It is this principle that has won me over.  \n\nThere is nothing strange about obsession with the body. After all, we have a strange relationship with it, do we not? It is definitively ours to own, yet we are not always fully in possession of it. That the sculptures, flags and motifs of the Verdubans are adorned with its components is representative of the importance of it to them. The question foremost in their minds is \"what are we made of?\" 
codex.24299d30fbaa7b208c20be5f9c426e15=What most amazes me is how relaxed the Verdubans are around one another. I particularly enjoy the liberalism of their social systems - take the Ear for example, a vast plaster sculpture inside which court is held, and \"hearings\" conducted. It acts as a forum for problems or concerns, and often the troubles of the wider world - for the Verdubans are as concerned for our welfare as their own.  \r\n\r\nClearly the Verdubans and the Saborians share some ancestry, given the similarities between the Ice god festival, and say, the average trip to the cloistrum in Momoros, where Saborian bathers celebrate each others' physical prowess. But for the Verdubans, it has become less about attaining perfection and showing off, and more about learning to understand and accept oneself. To feel comfortable in your own skin.
codex.1a87678dd64bfb6e23aec531a6d1fed6=The Great Marsha Correspondent \n8th Babbo 3031\n\nThe thousand or more protesters who camped outside both the Court of the Empress in Ten-Rui, and the Saborian capital Redusa over the course of these last few days, have been arrested and will be sentenced according to the laws of the two jurisdictions.\n\nWith both sides at full tilt, and the possibility of their remote-signal monsters trampling the Korchis mountainsides, it is no surprise that the campaign against the war has peaked. While it is in the liege-states of Melliflua and Chabuti that the superpowers are mining Atlas most furiously, the protesters are from all over Foundation, and there can be no doubt that the organisers are part of the Verduban anti-war groups \"Stable Foundation\" and \"Ban Atlas Weapons Now\" (BAWN). Recently BAWN claimed it had staged the protests in both cities.\n\n\"It is in their national character to protest causes they believe in,\" said Kilda Froogik the foreign ambassador, last week. Our near neighbours the Verdubans, however peculiar they may seem, are often the most outspoken and committed to relieving the world of injustice. Froogik was ambiguous about Marsha's position, \"Verduba's commendable politics and concern for the environment, which manifests in the worship of the Ice god, have long been respected by Great Marsha. While it is less in our nature to fight for lost causes, we must keep our own waters and grassy bogs clean.\" \n\nBAWN's banners are covered in slogans such as \"Stop mining Atlas, stop the war!\" and are using out-of-date Panyana research to back their claims. The paper to which their campaign frequently refers is an old one - drafted by Alcibiana of all people - and has generated an abundance of similar, but according to BAWN, \"overlooked\" papers in the three and three-quarter centuries since. A reduction of Atlas mining and use would need both Kioki and Sabor to back down, not to mention the rest of Foundation, a situation which looks increasingly unlikely.

Since then, the Krakenites of the Great Marshas have gathered with the unremitting intention of keeping these wonderful creatures alive. \nIt is not \"natural selection\" that defines the continued existence of the Kraken, but the \"unnatural selection\" imposed by our changes to their environment, our hunting of them, the vast number of ships in the seas and skies, water pollution, changes to the climate caused by our guzzling of Atlas.

When the beasts of our world die, we humans will be left in an empty Foundation, friendless and lost. We will suffer intolerable loneliness and displacement. All things are one - and whatever fate befalls the kraken, will soon befall us. \n\nMortin Granvik\nThe Krakenites

codex.fc368abcda5e83054c220ce607e2145e=I 'eard there was a beautiful lad up Mount o' Plenty my sister spyed. So we goes up togevver, and she turns round to me and says, \"there he is\". And she were right, there he was, tall dark stranger out in the field gathrin' corn. What 'maises me is what my sister does next. She shouts \"Oi, sexy!\" and then pushes me out from where we was hid, so it look like it was me what said it. \r\n\r\nThen he looks up, and smiles, but then he suddenly goes berserk-like. I says, \"what is it?\" an'ee says \"behind you!\"\r\n\r\nThat's when there's a creakin' like a coffin door, death comin' on us like, and there's a rustlin' like the winds o' change, and 'fore we know it there's a forest grown up round us, and plants in our face. We was pafetic, cos we jus' shrieked an' that, while this lad was threshin' his big knife tryin' to save us. \r\n\r\nFinally, he calms us down like, sayin' \"go left\" and what have you. Then we start cuttin' through these grasses with our hands but they're sharp like razors, and finally we meet him, but we're all covvered in blood like. And we crawl out on ar' bellies, and he's like \"well'un for gettin' out, people's died to them Sirens.\"\r\n\r\nWe 'ad dinner round theirs, it was hot corn soup. S'alright I spose, but they dint 'ave much since they gotta pay a lotta corn tithe. Said the Sirens been a right menace this year, and they don't want nuffink to do wiv corn no more, but there ain't nuffink else to choose.
codex.461f121259ec3b231a3501f05963f715=I was half-swimming, half-crawling through a bog, and as I neared the smoking wax lights, big stinking arms heaved me out of the water. Later, when I had been clothed in straw-lined pantalons and a pale wool fleece, he picked me up, and sat me down to dinner upon a three-legged stool. The Marshas smell like bilge, and I smelled like bilge too. Morray - that was his name - who had a round, ringworn face, said that I must eat the seaweed. I ate it. It was salty and sweet.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have a name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Azrudin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is your family, boy?\"\r\n\r\nMy brother wandered across the deck of my mind. \r\n\r\n\"Dispersed,\" said I.\r\n\r\nMorray slapped me on the back.\r\n\r\n\"You speak good Marsha, but you're Bandini. I know because of the mop on your head and the fluff above your lips. Besides you're not nearly broad enough to be a Marsha!\"
codex.7e9941bf89eab7f5ec45a2ddaab08041=We didn't know where we were going, one day to the next. It wasn't so bad, what with the war. But the Dew was teeming with hogwash; broken fixings and radio parts. There was a layer of Atlas dust over everything, and tarpaulins over that. Mother was ill, and she collected junk. Father was ill too, and insisted we keep it all. I tried tossing the really useless stuff overboard at night, but they noticed. I can see father's ruddy face now, his heavy hand juddering down upon me. \n\nThe only thing they couldn't keep hold of was their children. When we stopped in the Wahsili desert, and the parents scurried to gather the old shuttle springs and limpet gauges that were drowning in the sand, Marinello hid. Una, our dog, decided to follow. I watched them go, but didn't say a word to the parents when they'd returned. I knew this was Marinello's chance. It was only when we'd taken off and left the Wahsili that they realised my brother was gone.\n\n\"Where's t'other?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"T'other boy. You thrown him off too?\"\n\n\"No mother, not I.\"\n\n\"We need 'im,\" father said, and he thumped me.
codex.4c1122c0219f746196a5b937a8b0fab9=We went south-east for a thousand leagues, before we ran out of fuel, and the ship ditched deep down in the Great Marshas. The sun was low, and the baby cricks croaked. I remember as we squished down to land, the green sludgewater hugged the bow up to the poop deck, washing thickly over it. The parents scurried off carrying their looting sticks, looking for something divine. \n\nI ripped off my dirty clothes, and dove into the swamp water. It was cold. I swam a mile, and hid among the roots. I chewed pieces of mangrove. It tasted how I imagined medicine. I lay on a slab of rock to dry and fell asleep. When I awoke, I saw the Coral Dew was gone. Both Marinello and I were finally free!
codex.ca10a2fc6c26b0aee45b4c783c3fadc1=Morray slurped at his seaweed, which like a ladder, inched its way up to the tongue and trapdoor. \r\n\r\n\"I know some Saborian,\" he said, in Saborian.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you speak well,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nMorray's mouth opened wide, and then to my surprise, he began to laugh heartily. It turns out, he didn't know too much Saborian after all.\r\n\r\n\"and Bandini?\" he said, \"do you not have a language?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was lost...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. Terrible,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"...but a wise-woman kept it. She told her daughter. Then her daughter told her daughter's daughter. Now many of us keep it in our hearts, and mutter it under our breath.\"\r\n \r\nMorray put his hands on his knees, and lifted himself up. He was broad, but not tall. In one movement, he took our bowls, danced with his wife, then spun out of the door. He poured the food scraps on the grass outside, and the pig trottered over and suckled at the patch. The pig was coated in a chemise of bright green algae.
codex.9db4e12e1f548c407b5c14053739af12=Morray returned to his chair, and became lost in thought. I stared at the planked floor, it was rickety, and I could see the marshwater beneath us through the joins.\r\n\r\n\"What of the troubles?\" he said gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir,\" I said, \"we've always been afloat. It's often what's saved us from trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" he said, leaning back on his stool and folding his arms, \"it is easy to lose track of the world if you are always afloat. One should come down to earth once in awhile. If you forget what you come from, you lose what you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"We weren't always in the clouds, but born from the mud like pigs.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded to the pig, who snuffled around the frame of the door.\r\n\r\n\"I heard pigs like clean water, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clever lad, you're right.\" He smiled and scratched his rubbery nose.
codex.00ed413141e1d2155dd6ca5d84b86007=\"What think you of Sabor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate Sabor, and they hate us,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Your words?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what mother said, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"As simple as that, eh? Yes I suppose it is. Your mother left you here in the Great Marshas?\"\r\n\r\n\"I left myself here.\" \r\n\r\nI smiled proudly at the thought.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shan't ask further,\" he said with more sadness than I felt myself, \"you seem alright considering. Mari, bring us some Shnockel.\"\r\n\r\nMari tutted tenderly. She took a beaker from the larder by the scruffly stair, and poured the Shnockel into two small glasses. When I brought it to my lips I could smell it burn.\r\n\r\n\"Good sponging,\" Morray barked cheerfully. I drank, then I wiped my eyes dry on my arm. Mari brought me water to wash away the prickle in my throat.
codex.921f3fe2dbe8e38017bac809cef3c6db=I recounted our last encounter with the Saborians. The sky was blue and bold. At Redusa's south skygate, we saw silver coruscation, and we breathed deep, because the godhands were there waiting. But they let us in easily because we had Atlas. The parents ran the stones to the man at the dock, took their reward in junk, and then we paddled the Coral Dew back up to the gates on the updrafts. The godhands saw us off with a fanfare of foul handsigns. \r\n\r\nOur homeward journey lasted a moon. As we approached we saw a sandstorm had gathered there, and though I should have kept the cloth to my face, I was too desperate to see the popels - the palace shields - shining. As we rattled beyond the veil of sand, I remember it was very quiet. Then heard the deafening void below, where the palace must have gone, and I cried at all that had been lost forever.
codex.3b68ba4b9507e47cfe1d1c834f507fb8=\"Did you see the Hole?\" said Morray.\n\n\"The Hole, sir?\" \n\n\"The Hole,\" said Mari, without looking up from her rinsing. \n\n\"Oh, I see...the Palace of the Old Kings, the lallara court, the east gate market...all were taken by it,\" I said. \n\nMorray nodded as if this agreed with what he already knew. Mari moved to the fire, and gave the splayed swamp creatures a last turn on the spit above it. Then she took the spit pole down, and with her tongs, swept the meat from the skewer onto a broad brass platter. I looked at the mound of meat and felt ill.\n\n\"It's ok boy. Those leapers are for my hard day of work tomorrow. Don't worry yourself about being overstuffed, for I can see that's what you are.\"\n\nWhat a relief, I thought. Mari and Morray were attending me fondly, and I was beginning to feel at home. I patterned a Saborian skyline in water on the table, dotting a tiny replica of the Coral Dew beside it. \n\n\"Well, they've both flown over us ,\" said Mari, \"Kioki and Sabor\". She dried her hands on a white towel. \"But there's nothing here they can use.\"\n\n\"That's what they think, anyway!\" said Morray, \"It's under the marsh damps, see. All our Atlas.\"\n\n\"We'll never lay a finger on it,\" said Mari, \"and over my dead body, nor will they.\"
codex.07c5e6174c87c199ecd8a11eacbe3763=The next day I awoke, and I felt so light in the bed, I snoozed. When I was ready, I stood up and looked from the window of the little shack on sticks. It was raining lightly, and a hiss came from the water.\r\n\r\nA squat gown was ready above the door. I took it and put it on. I sensed some working arrangement was all but in place for me. At morning supper, Morray was eating his spit-roasted leapers.\r\n\r\n\"They're better cold,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure, sir,\" I said.  \r\n\r\n\"Azrudin, there's no cause to 'sir' me, as if I were Saborian. In the Marsha all are equal. Once you have helped Mari in the kitchen, and with suds in the washtub, you may rest. Then we can hear your stories. We like stories.\"\r\n\r\nSo I worked around the shack in the days, and I told stories at night. My telling was shaky, but soon improved. I blended truth and lies, no longer sure what I had and hadn't seen. The man and his wife were rapt, and insisted I continue, even when I'd tired of hearing myself.
codex.7d14d8a18cf468f27e138d953601f0d1=\"..into a great set of jaws,\" I said, and they applauded.\r\n\r\n\"I had no idea those things existed in the desert,\" said Mari, tears at the corners of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, not feeling I needed to say anything more.\r\n\r\n\"When do you plan to leave?\" said Morray.\r\n\r\n\"What, sir?\" I said, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"When do you plan to finish telling stories and go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I...hadn't thought of it.\" \r\n\r\n\"Well you must steer your own ship now. You cannot stay here forever. Don't you aspire to find your poor brother? Wouldn't it comfort you to know he was alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sense he is still alive,\" I said, \"that is how it is to be a twin. But he is far away, and I have no way to reach him,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"There are always ways and means Azrudin,\" said Mari.
codex.815174f0db7f0e29f58a1ddc14f1600d=Mari waddled down the wet wooden walkway, her feet hugging the wire mesh. She carried an extraordinarily long stick. It was reed, with a bound handle at one end, and a Karem silver hook at the other that had tarnished. She swung it over the lotus lagoon, and it made a plunk as it entered. She pitched it downward until she was bent double, her hand almost in the water. Mari twizzled the bound end, and a mudcloud stirred, and an orange shimmer of fish spilled up.\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Left. Left,\" said Morray.\r\n\r\nShe swished, then made a frustrated grunt. A bubble rose. \r\n\r\n\"Almost,\" he said. Then there was a grinding metal noise, and a blubber of bubbles rose. From below came the prow of a ship so large, that when it had fully revealed itself, it was three or four times my height. It was made entirely of steel, like a Saborian warship.  \r\n\r\n\"Climb aboard,\" said Morray, tossing me the matted, slimy ropeladder. \r\n\r\nAs I levered up over onto the deck, I disturbed a leaper and it suffered a momentary spasm, flitting about on its haunches, before hopping off and away.\r\n\r\n\"Ah frogginses, I hope they haven't nibbled the risers,\" said Mari.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be fine,\" said Morray.
codex.189f32ae9cf8e6c9bb464ea4fe40b261=They stayed below deck, while I lay in the small shaden provided by the cabin skylight. It was too hot. \r\n\r\n\"I see it! The Lighter of the Lamps! It's ok to come up sir, it's safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me be the judge of that.\"\r\n\r\nMorray's voice was muffled by the great bundle of fabric over his head and body, with which he hoped to keep out the sand and sun. \r\n\r\nWe looked at the great tower below, and around it the empty dock platforms. \r\n\r\nThe heat had addled me. It made me feel hopeless. \"We don't know where to start looking,\" I said, \"why did we even come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come now, there must be something,\" said Mari, \"are you sure it was here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was somewhere near the tower, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself,\"  \r\n\r\nI sulked, but I knew she was right. My brother was all I had. \r\n\r\nSuddenly Morray exclaimed. He was tracking something with the spyglass. A fleeting black dot. We watched it running across the Wahsili, and I knew what it was. It was Una, our lovely Una.
codex.ef6d4ceb01500c8a81e383f7b8d1ab64=I kept Una until she died at the age of nineteen. \r\n\r\nIf I listen to my heart, I can still hear the bounce of my brother's pulse. He must have survived the Hole, survived seven years of limbo, he must have. Perhaps he is out there among these islands.
codex.9a68a300f8d797f77595b127ea33b6b3=Two months of darkness had been horrible. The acid, the undulation of the muscles beneath us. Luckily I still had my lighter.\r\n\r\nI unfolded the map of Melliflua.\r\n\r\n\"Won't be needing this anymore,\" I said to Alika, but he wasn't listening.\r\n\r\nI pulled away the cord that edged the map, then snipped an inch-long piece of it with the knife, putting the remainder away for later. \r\n\r\nI held up my lighter. At one end of the stomach was another chamber I remembered from school as the duodenal ampulla. A steady drip oozed from a vesicle on the wall. I slopped over and held the mess tin under it. Once a little of the ooze had cooled and solidified in the tin, I pushed the small piece of cord into its middle and stood it on end. Then I left the tin to fill to the brim.\r\n\r\nI had to conserve the lighter's fuel. So I slopped back to Alika in the dark, feeling for the rectangle of tarpaulin on which he lay, my satchel, his belt, his warm back. I could smell his blubber-breath. \r\n\r\n\"Fancy having all this junk in your belly.\" I said. I knelt and stroked his head. His beard was long and soft. \"Does it still hurt?\"\r\n\r\nI felt for the gash where his leg had snagged on the tooth. The bandage would need changing soon, and we didn't have anything left.
codex.7c6507739293f7311f97f0d9c2d2cede=I put the lighter to the wick of the candle. It caught! There was a puff smoke before it mellowed to a steady flame.    \r\n\r\nThe floor shifted. \r\n\r\n\"Surge!\" I said. Alika groaned but braced. We had learned to be ready.\r\n\r\nI held the candle tightly between my knees, gripping a handful of stomach lining on either side. \r\n\r\nThe roar was deafening as the whale vented its blowhole a few levels above us. She seemed to shake and spin and turn in an effort to exhale the candle smoke. Acid washed in around us.\r\n\r\nThen the coughing began, with every hack she bounced us up to the ceiling and back down. Through the oesophageal slit, I saw the faintest light before the rumbling stopped. \r\n\r\nWhen it did, Alika was ill. The stench of the place was dreadful.
codex.960e593a0bcda1479932d1b2236c9ee9=\"But we're still alive,\" I said, touching his hand. We had been down here a long time.\r\n\r\nAlika scraped up fat with his hand and forced it into his mouth. He retched as he chewed. Then he scooped from the little liquid pool we had collected - freshwater straight from the oesophagus, he bolted it all down. \r\n\r\n\"It's not enough just to be alive,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing left out there. Nothing but the storm.\" \r\n\r\n\"We have to try,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI nodded. We'd wait for another surge. If we timed it right, we could make it, I was sure of it.
codex.74b4253127d90804278c22acdf094e39=\"Surge!\" \r\n\r\nWe felt the beast push upward. Now was the chance. We sidestepped the pit of stomach acid and the coagulated nests of half-digested prey, and grappling with the loose skin of the stomach wall, we made the ascent to the oesophageal slit. \r\n\r\nThe beast tilted suddenly, as if it were diving. Alika slipped for a moment, but I caught him and held him long enough that he could recover his grip.\r\n\r\n\"Is it diving back into the Hole?\"\r\n\r\nWe waited, then suddenly the beast surged upward again. We climbed on until we reached a platform of muscle, and the slit.\r\n\r\n\"Me first,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Be quick, you know the drill,\" he said. \r\n\r\nI steeled myself, then as we had practised, dove headfirst through the gap. It was a clean dive. There was a phonic roar from above, but nothing more. I wriggled up the narrow tract as fast as I could, Alika just behind me. The creature roared all the while, and we were drenched in secretions from the walls.
codex.71a38a18819f8e3e59c2b03560d4e208=\"This time, we don't touch the tongue,\" he said. The incident with his leg flashed by and I winced.\r\n\r\n\"If we get that far,\" I said. \r\n\r\nClaustrophobia. We had to get out. One mistake and we'd be crushed in the gullet, or vomited into the void. We'd thought about inducing a vomit, believe me - but what if we shot out, and found nothing out there? What if we just fell forever?\r\nSafer to stay here, but this was no life for anyone. \r\n\r\nThe longer the crawl takes, the more it irritates the creature. Even for seasoned stomach-dwellers it was unpleasant, but we went as quick as we could. \r\n\r\n\"The tongue begins,\" I said. A faint light suffused the oval as far as the lips on the opposite side. We were careful to avoid standing on the tongue, instead clinging to the outer wall of the mouth. All I wanted was to see the mouth open, just for a moment. To see a white hope beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Keep concentrating,\" yelled Alika, \"those teeth are sharp.\"\r\n\r\nHis leg was in a bad way, but he was doing the best he could. If we failed now. It'd have to come off, and we had nothing to cut it off with.\r\n\r\n\"There are a lot more teeth than I remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"The trouble is getting over to the far side without using the tongue.\"\r\n\r\nThen it happened, the jaw opened and a great flood of cold air rushed in. And light! After so long, light!
codex.c16c2771853d15cc66cff122dab0c187=Before I could cover my eyes, there was a heavy jolt and we were knocked to the back of the mouth. The jaw bounced up and down, up and down. The teeth chattered together, and pieces of beetle carapace flew back towards us.\r\n\r\n\"That's what happened last time,\" shouted Alika, \"sooner or later the tongue's going to catch us, and we'll be back down with the beetles.\" \r\n\r\n\"Alright, alright, just hold on tight!\"\r\n\r\nThe tongue started slapping up against the palate, and the bits of beetle slid one-by-one down the chute beneath us. Just when I thought I'd lost my strength, the jaw stopped. We dropped down on the tongue, and lay out on our backs for a moment, exhausted. \r\n\r\n\"Phew.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a close thing.\"\r\n\r\nA darkness so familiar now. I flicked my lighter, barely a dribble of fuel in the cylinder. The doors of the creature's mouth were firmly closed. I let my head fall back down. I shone it above me, and saw a little hole. What hole was that?\r\n\r\n\"The trachea! If we climb up we can leave by the blowhole.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's too narrow, it won't be able to breathe.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I'm counting on.\" I said.
codex.ba31b3d2121299bc2be1ee71d7a77efe=The wheezing came as soon as we'd wedged ourselves in. We lay as flat as we could to the trachea so that air could still flow. \r\n\r\nNow, \"jam into the blowhole\" I said. And we did, squeezing ourselves up into the upright shaft. I felt water on my face, a fresh mist from outside. We were so close.\r\n\r\nThunk. Thunk. THUNK.\r\n\r\nWe shot up the blow hole at high speed, volleyed up into the open air. I felt my stomach lurch as we went up, but could see nothing through the dredge of mucous covering my face. \r\n\r\n\"Wahh,\" I heard Alika scream. \r\n\r\nWe landed on the great beast's back with a soft thud. We clung to the rough tessellations of its skin, and wiped the gunk from our eyes. All around us clouds, the sun! The Hole was changed. It had retreated below and formed a thunderous cloud-bed.\r\n\r\n\"What bliss! Saved by this majestic beauty,\" said Alika, patting the creature's back.
codex.f63758622e0afa7429a53886d6968437=A phonic roar rose from the blowhole. \"We are the children!\" it sounded like.\r\n\r\n\"These children must love to play here now,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Children?\" said Alika.\r\n\r\n\"These beasts. They play here now.\"\r\n\r\nWe saw others in the distance rising and falling between tiny islands, each a world adrift. Of Foundation they are but fragments of memory, preserving something, anything, of what we were.\r\n\r\n\"Now dearest, how do we get off this thing?\"
codex.453a5dbcde96396fcf56c7661f581c63=From the original Mellifluan, part of a new volume called, \"Stories to cheer us up.\"\n\n\"The worst people are convinced that what they see, is what we all must be seeing. If however, you start seeing things no-one else does, you're likely just mad.\"\n\nThat's a proverb I've spent most of my life trying to disprove. \n\nI am not an inventor and I am not a scientist, though lately I am beginning to wonder. Principally I have been an artist, and a lover of fruit wine. I have lived a life of dishevelment, but I have my uses; as a drum for my friends to beat me for example. I told them to stop - the sounds my body made when hit with hands and sticks weren't interesting enough for them to carry on - but it turned out they wanted my money and my booze. Bottoms to them. I'm in a better place now, living beside the sea, watching the birds breaking their bum-eggs over horrified tourists. I don't belong here either, but at least it's nice. \n\nAnyway, what I wanted to write about was how much I've enjoyed living, and how I thought I might die soon. Of belly-rot, or by my friends finding me and beating me so hard my head comes off. But before all that, I have a contribution to make. Artists everywhere will love me for it, women will love me for it.\n\nI have found a new colour, and I'm going to call it \"breen\". Wonderful breen!
codex.a86896da75cbd1e2d35e658d2835d8dd=Breen is a colour I discovered after a very long night. It was four in the morning, maybe five, and I had missed the last skyship home, but I was happy to stretch out for forty winks on the platform of the skyway. I was pleased to find it cleaner there, and less refuse-strewn, than the floor of my apartment. I was tipsy too, that helped. I'd sold a painting, and I'd spent the proceeds as if it were my last night on Foundation. The money was completely gone on wine, and as the sun began to rise, my venter felt ready to vent. As I lay on my side, desperately hoping to recover, I looked across the platform and into the dawn cloud. It was there that I saw it; a new colour. \r\n\r\nI may be naughty, but I never lie. I saw what I saw, don't tell me I didn't!\r\n\r\nI haven't seen breen since. I tried to mix it of course - I tried for months. But there's nothing in my paint tin like it. I remember the week after that glorious night, finally waking up from my nightmares. I kneaded a figure eight of bread, and turned on the radio. An old song came on, and it made me think of my lost loves. Not loaves, loves. All thirty-six of 'em. I had some fruit wine. Then I took the bread out of the oven, but it was too soon, and the inside was raw. I threw it in the bin, and the whole process somehow reminded me of breen. I was lucky, if the bread hadn't gone bad I might have forgotten breen. Wonderful breen!
codex.18acb06c543078158ee1eabd12478b6b=So I think it was around the time I belched in the copper kettle, and an echo rattled around the copper tubes blowing the nightguards eardrums, that I was finally evicted from the factory. The guard and I are still on good terms, so it's fine. I just can't have any more of their wine. I've moved on to the Gariet factory now, and I can tell you that their wine drinks like pig slurry, but that their security is negligible. \n\nObviously, I hoped the factory was my ticket back to the land of breen. I even tried drinking until four or five in the morning, lying out on the same skyway platform at what I thought was the same angle. But I just couldn't quite remember what that colour was like! It was off the musical scale, it tasted salty and prickly like a sandal thing, but at the same time not. It felt like desiccated goldfish to the touch, but dreary and aimless too, you know?\n\nI decided I needed to be more practical. I am so useless about practical. I can't even remember where I get my paints from. \nThen one day there was a big party. I didn't have a paper invite as such, but I heard the noise. I went to complain, but the music and the company were wonderful, so I stayed. Then I got talking to this man about my new colour, breen. Celery-face was wearing an aquaponics suit, and I'm not sure whether it was hired for the party, or for some genuine undertaking. I think perhaps the latter, because at one point he used the hose to hoover up a stray piece of goo that was stuck to his sleeve.
codex.5a90815b4e1cc0b15e05ed1cd46249e5=When I asked him why he would do such a thing, he gave the cryptic reply, \"nothing is as satisfying as food you've grown yourself.\"  \r\nI had immediately taken a liking to him. But when he got talking about breen, he became even more enchanting.\r\n\"I know!\" he said,  I have seen it myself!\" he said, \"in the Mitochondriae!\"\r\n\"Oh..!\" I said, nodding sagely. I had finally found someone as queer as me.\r\n\"I feel like we could talk about this for hours, Benoit,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was getting rowdy, so we went outside to stargaze, hoping for some inspiration. He looked like a stick of celery, with leafy hair, and a sallow face. He was really quite green.\r\nI asked him a question I'd never asked anyone before. I said, \"do you think anyone else has seen breen?\"\r\nHe looked at his watch, then back at me. He said he had to go. I was already feeling gin-wobbly, so I just let him.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I was worried I wouldn't see him again. In a way, that night had been more exciting than the act of discovering breen itself. It felt like part of a bigger movement, a great revolution. I had found a fellow breenite, and life was wonderful. Wonderful breen!
codex.50d2f6899178720e3f13a6e2021f61cc=It turns out his name was Scatch. I saw his leafy hair poking over the top of a deck chair down by the seaside, at what I think is probably the cleanest beach in Melliflua. (The Chabuti ones are better. I don't shout about it, but I think the Chabuti aren't too bad really. Anyway, don't get me started on politics).\r\n\r\nAnyway, it wasn't Scatch's hair, but the hair of a beautiful lady-friend. Natural selection, he said it was. They had the same kind of face, the same kind of hair. \r\n\r\n\"We met at a party,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, right,\" I said. Same party. Scatch had lied when he said he had to go, I think he ditched me to go after her. I was a bit annoyed about that, and I tried to hide it, but it was hard to stay happy because he was being so lukewarm. I was about to mention breen, when he veered off.\r\n\r\n\"What's happened to your belly?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What d'you mean?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"It's swollen like a lallara ball.\" \r\n\r\nI didn't like this new Scatch, she'd changed him.\r\n\r\n\"Has it changed that much in a month?\" \r\n\r\n\"It's been a year.\"\r\n\r\nAnnoying! Last chance.\r\n\r\n\"Ok. Look, it's wonderful to see you,\" I said, \"I'd been hoping to see you all this time, to talk about breen.\"\r\n\r\nLady celery scowled. Scatch quickly put a hand on her knee.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry we met that night Benoit,\" he said, \"and I'm sorry, but I don't ever want to see you again.\"
codex.65fe4fde5451e36b61c99b9752de5d11=I thought he was joking, but his face seemed grave. I don't know why, but tears came to my eyes. He sat down across the axle of his deckchair, and looked out to sea. I turned and sobbed, trudging my way slowly back up the beach. I was hoping he'd call for me to wait, but he didn't. The sand felt so hot, but the world and its people so cold. \r\n\r\nThen, a lifeline, a tap on the shoulder and I spun 'round, thinking it would be Scatch, but instead it was his lady-friend.\r\n\r\n\"It's my fault,\" she said, \"please don't cry. I never wanted anyone to cry.\" Then she herself began to weep.       \r\n\r\n\"You don't believe him do you? You don't believe in breen,\" I said, and by now, we were both in tears. Hers seemed just as earnest as mine, I checked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't...know,\" she said, looking back at Scatch, whose solemn vigil over the waves was unbreakable.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" I said, \"don't worry about me, look after you. That's the important thing. Look after Scatch, he needs you now.\"\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I said some other good stuff that sounded right too. I got out of the sun as quick as I could and off for a good glug of fruit wine.\r\n\r\nSomething must have happened, because a week (I think it was) later, Scatch came around to my accommodations, and we spent a pleasant evening talking about breen. He said the lady had decided to move on, but that he didn't mind. He said breen was more important, and that he couldn't let me feel like I was searching alone.\r\n\r\nSometimes we are destined for things. Wonderful breen!
codex.0299178fe66b9ca2076e652d170a1fad=Scatch pressed something into my palm. His pale face twitched nervously, and his expression was serious. I peeled back my fingers one by one, wondering if this was the moment. To my disappointment, in my hand was a piece of Atlas.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I said. I didn't see how Atlas came into the argument.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the colour you saw?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You mean, is this breen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the shard, and poked at it. It rolled across my palm. I'd seen Atlas before, and it didn't interest me. I suppose I'd always turned a blind eye. It never seemed the treasure they made it out to be. But its colour? I looked so hard at the stone I thought i'd see through it.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I said, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"I think this might be it you know?\" said Scatch optimistically, snatching the flake from my hand and holding it up to the light. \r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I need it, Benoit. I need to study the stone further, see if it really is breen,\" he said.
codex.a5d33fbe961504081c56e846501e9bcf=I remained unconvinced. That night at the skyship station, when I came back to myself, I was sure that if I ever saw breen again I'd know it immediately. This rock in Scatch's hand gave me a more uncertain feeling, as if the colour of the stone were the wrong word, when the right one was on the tip of my tongue. \r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I said again, less sure, \"perhaps it is close to this, but not quite. I mean, isn't this more green than breen?\"\r\n\r\nScatch looked at the stone again for a few moments, before lowering his weedy celery arm to his side, and closing a white-knuckled fist around it.  \r\n \r\n\"Oh Benoit, what do we do if this isn't breen?\" \r\n\r\nHis voice wavered. His yellow-green face, normally so buoyant, had plummeted through the clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fret Scatch. We are looking for breen, but we may never find it. That's the beauty you see, the discovery itself is the byplay, the journey the main event.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Scatch, who was shaking now.\r\n\r\n\"We can't seek answers where we can't be sure an answer exists.\"\r\n\r\n\"NO BENOIT! NO! All we ever do is seek breen, that's all I am anymore! I cannot...I cannot!\"\r\n\r\nScatch unwound his arm and let loose the pebble of Atlas across the studio. It skimmed through my tin of paints, dispersing indigo and vermilion as if a bullet rupturing the hide of a beast, before bursting through a neat hole in the window pane.
codex.20ce77019833115e11d7f263b9457c87=Scatch's fraught face remained like an afterimage at the door long after he'd fled. Oh my poor friend, how he suffered. I'd not see him for weeks after that - shame kept him away.\n\nStill, it gave me a bit of time to think, and the thinking I did was remarkable. The question I dreamt up was this - in our search for breen, how could I claim to be an authority on colour, when out there somewhere, on a world tour of his paintings and pigments was Hamesh the Sweet?! \n\nIt was decided. I would find my master, and re-acquaint him with his own successes, massage the ego, that sort of thing, and then we'd wax lyrical about the old days, and finally I'd work him over to the subject of breen. Had he come across it? What colour was it? Was it a secret he had already discovered and kept to himself?\n\nI tracked him down, as I suspected, to the passenger list of the frillship Bellowes. By all accounts the Bellowes is greatest cruise skyship ever known. The ship was in Ten-Rui! Joy of joys! But getting onto it was rather trickier, I mean the fees are rude. Especially if you are not well acquainted with the ship's proprietor J. Verdamion Phollo VI, and are a forgotten creative such as I.\n\nBut, I managed to entangle myself with a blotto clown in the port tavern, who insisted that I climb aboard his \"gigantic vessel\". He led me aboard the Bellowes, and before we reached his cabin, I had to disappoint him. I trod on his oversize shoe to trip him, then I ran and hid in one of the lifeboats.\n\nI heard the great trouser-blast of a horn the following morning, and woke to see the Bellowes chugging festively out of Ten-Rui into the great unknown. Avoiding the drunken clown aboard ship made things rather difficult initially. I didn't know how he'd react to seeing me after our little contretemps. To make things worse, I had seen no sign of Hamesh anywhere.
codex.d4a57cb6738df9422112c7a5e678463d=I was enjoying a complimentary fruit wine and gazing through the viewing glass out to the clouds, when luck swung in my direction like a favourably big pendulum. There was a clatter of silver trays and foodstuffs, and appalled noises from the other passengers.\r\n\r\n\"Get off me devil's wind!\"\r\n\r\nThat guttural blare could only be Hamesh. I bubbled with anticipation, but had to remain calm. I looked around casually, and to my exhilaration, saw the old master. He was even bigger than I remember him, and as sweet as ever in addressing the hapless waiter, whose cutleries lay spangled across the foot-lit deck. \r\n\r\n\"If you touch me again lad, I'll touch you. Very firmly in the Ogballs.\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter knocked aside, Hamesh came striding towards the viewing glass, looking out on Foundation and muttering angrily under his breath. I watched, and waited for the prime moment. \r\n\r\nI imagined the Bellowes must have thought his appointment a coup - they offer him passage to whichever port he desires, and in return his mere presence makes the cruise a sell-out. But how they would then come to regret it; caging themselves in with the beast, watching powerless as he shreds the furniture, and knocks the stuffing out of the crew. Setting trepidation aside, I reached up to the giant and tapped him on the shoulder. 
codex.79874c1f44a16bcb273819c41ae1532d=\"Master?\" I ventured. \r\n\r\n\"What now!?\" He said, lurching towards me, his fists raised. I realised he had no recollection of me whatsoever. I tried to think of ways in which I formerly placated him. Windmills? No that wasn't it. Food. No. What was it? I resorted to the first thing that came into my head.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever come across a new colour? I have, and I've named it breen, for it was a little bit brown and a little bit green, but also neither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Breen?!\"\r\n\r\nThere was an interval, as I watched him countdown to detonation. I had made him unhappy.\r\n\r\n\"Argggh!\"\r\n\r\nI picked up and started to run. It was an early advantage on the giant man, but frenzied as he was, he quickly caught up. I was therefore forced to use cunning. I began to pull everything in my path - bellropes, guyballs, waiters and their coat-tails - into his. What I didn't anticipate, as I rushed towards the solitary exit to the lounge, was yet greater jeopardy. There before me, disagreeably resurfaced and steaming from a night of booze and unfulfilled passion, was my friend the clown. His first attempt to stop me was to pull a pastel-pink bottle rocket from his britches, and jettison it towards my face.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I anticipated something of the sort, and ducked below the papery salvo, which then struck my pursuer in the face. Hamesh clutched at his eyes, and as the clown went to comfort him, I made my escape through the open door. I hid in a lifeboat, and waited for the next port, from whence I hitched back to Ten-Rui.
codex.d21edbb3a06bfb2462064f1825f7ab57=Scatch is tired, his face grey and crusty, his hair frayed and yellowed. I will always love that old stick. \n\nWe have not seen much of one another lately, there is something too terrifying about him for me, and in turn he thinks I make his condition worse. \n\nWe had a few more outings, but his fits of rage are comparable with those of my old master Hamesh. Both striving for something that may or may not be obtainable. Just shows, you think you have everything, Atlas, money, booze, whatever, but there's always something else missing, some deep thing. As for me, I'm just happy to be alive. You never know, we might wake up tomorrow to find it all disappeared.\n\nYet Scatch and I have promised to stay in touch, should our moment come. That moment we have both sought so long, the rediscovery of breen! Wonderful breen!

They dwell along the banks of once great rivers turned streams, that trickle silently into the abyss. We have not yet seen these tribes.

Millennia of books and knowledge lost, but for the pathetic scraps of wisdom I can recall (so far, 46 slim volumes and papers on various topics, thirty-four classic studies, and sixteen books on the specifics of aeronautics). This feels the most important exam I'll ever have taken.  \n\nI was pleased to have some theories of my own validated on arriving at Capulca. As my lifeboat descended, I could make out an outline through the dark vapour. Though I could no longer rely on my navigational instruments, my presumption that this was the southerly continent of Koinos proved correct. Furthermore, I noted that it seemed to be holding together, in spite of everything.\n\nThis really only confirms the paper I unveiled at the Efflua symposium, nearly ten years ago. Back then, findings demonstrated that Koinos was stable, and experiencing prolonged tectonic intervals. This was hard to understand given measurements everywhere else in Foundation, which were off the charts.  \n\nWe knew it was connected to Atlas, but time ran out on the project. Time ran out on all of us. My theory on the cause of this variation, remains speculative. Nevertheless, it helps me to talk about it. \n\nWhat I still believe to this day, is that the tribes of this tangled continent leave very little trace of their having been here at all. They leave no footprint. They put as much in as they take out. Here, there are no cities, no skyways, no mines. It wasn't quarried raw. Koinos was too wild, too far distant to ever persuade Kioki or Sabor. \n\nDid native respect for nature keep Koinos whole? I think of strip-mined Melliflua and Chabuti at the end, and I shudder.\n\n- Josia of Efflua, Gallish.

Do you have food, water and a bed, that I might recover?\"\nAnd haughty Little Toes replied, \"I have all of those things, but you shall not have them. This is a dainty place for the dainty.\" The pilgrim bowed and went on his way, but his face was bitter. \n\nA month on, Little Toes went to Muskdog to peddle her rites. At House Square, the same pilgrim, dressed in the same ragged clothes, was peddling rites of his own. \"House of Big Toes?\" she scoffed, \"There is no such house!\"\n\"There is now,\" replied the pilgrim resolutely, although it was true he had no patronage, and Little Toes wondered if he would survive the winter.\n\"I am from the cold north,\" he said, \"worry not for me, but for yourself,\" at which she laughed and went about her business.  \n\nA year on, and winter came again. Little Toes went to Muskdog to peddle her rites, since business had been terrible, and she had no food or clothes to speak of. She passed through House Square, and seeing the pilgrim was departed from his beggary, said \"Ha, I have it bad, but at least I'm still alive.\"\nIn the centre of the square was a new construction. Its borders made of pure emerald. Out of curiosity she went in, only to discover the same pilgrim peddling his rites. \"What are you doing in this grand place?\" she said.\n\"This is my House,\" he replied, \"and you are welcome here.\"\n\"Yours!? It cannot be.\"\n\"Why can it not?\" replied Big Toe, and Little Toe then realised he spoke true.\n\nHouse of Verduba, greatest of the Houses, what do we see through the Ice?\n\nSeek to exclude and you shall be excluded. Charity is sovereign.
codex.5cac13a655d65feb809266d14eeeb0a2=Verse 5\nThe parable of the wild forager.\nThe bees and flies do not deter the wild forager. He owns nothing, and his talent brings little reward, but still he goes at it every day. \nOne day, he finds a crop of strange berries. When he returns to town, all gather around him, and offer him great sums for the strange berries.\n\nHouse of Verduba, greatest of the Houses, what do we see through the Ice?\n\nA singular habit can become a beautiful talent, if you work at it.
codex.f2680c618027f0f6a80aad2adab9f27e=Verse 6\nThe parable of the fire held in Ice.\nOnce there was an acolyte of Nem Chi, who called herself a Pyrite. She shaped the flame in her hands, the heathen, and would commit arson on the houses of the living. When the Ice Priest of the House of Ice confronted her, she threatened him. \n\n\"See in my hand, this fire, which burns the houses of those who deny the Pyrites. The ones who live for fire, who cook with fire, who use fire. Priest of Ice, you shall suffer, for I know you do not obey master Nem Chi.\"\n\n\"Acolyte of fire, you shall no longer be allowed to burn the houses of the village of Gautine, no matter how cold your heart. Return below Foundation, where you came up with the beetles and the Rajas. Nem Chi, your master, is a fool.\"\n\n\"Who are you to say it? Fire vanquishes ice! Do you deny the power of fire?\" and with that threw her flame upon a stick, which she held to the holy House of Ice, ready to burn it down.\n\"Fire has power,\" said the Priest of Ice, \"but ice has the greater.\" With that he gave her a push so hard that she fell into the icy lake. Her flame was extinguished, and she struggled for her life.\n\n\"Save me, heathen!\" she cried to him. But the priest knew there was no help for her, and so let her drown.\n\nHouse of Verduba, greatest of the Houses, what do we see through the Ice?\n\nThrough ice is more ice. Ice may melt, but it shall burn long after the last fire is extinguished.
codex.ea2ed0d4f486d085babece23bc14137f=Book of Soil\nTranslated from Ishgiruan by Fasium, a survivor. \n\nIn Wellah, the Empress counts each clod of soil from east to west, the hot orb upon her back. There are four creatures at the command of her sword. The Crane, who flies in the night. The shimmering Snake, who can bite. The Dragon-Dog, who may fight. And most precious, the Mouse who gives her sight.
codex.182ee4c7600c465a86376b0f3e7eb67a=Oh that Mouse, see his black-tipped tail swish! Let his long legs flop upon the earth. Watch him fall on his back, then take pleasure spinning in the dust. Then wait a brief moment, before he goes around again, and again, and again. He is one with the soil. Back on his feet, he is alert, with beady black eyes and whiskers that twitch. \r\n\r\nHe is waiting for my blessing. So I bless him with a stroke of the hand, and the sensuous softness prevails beneath my touch, the fur doming her head is smooth, and he closes his eyes with every stroke. \r\n\r\nThen he cannot abide love anymore, and he bounds to the far side of the courtyard on his stilt-like legs. I tell him \"come back little one, a storm is coming, and you will have no fun.\"\r\nA servant lifts the spirit up by his tail.\r\n\"Not like that!\" I command, and the face of the servant falls. He is taken below and beaten. The Mouse is gathered and lowered into my bathwater, which he does not love like he loves the dirt. 
codex.55286e0b8d1518856ea6d286ec0e5c1a=I called to the long-legged Crane, who is my doctor, and I said \"Tell me, what news of the war?\"\r\n\r\nThe Crane has wispy grey plumes, \"Empress, war began many thousands of years ago. War persists now, and war will continue to persist, even when our world has ended.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"You are wise Crane, but how can you know the world will come to an end?\"\r\n\r\nThe Crane replied, \"because of the greed of men and women. But a balance will hold for a time, when more shall be content than not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for the present? What of the present war between Wellah and Gondola?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must ask the serpent and the dog.\"
codex.83d6d96fdb5f83bcc76e0d0539a7dca7=I bore the Mouse upon my skirts. His treats were sewn into the hem, so that he could follow my every step. We left the pasture behind, walking up the slope, where the water trickled down into the valley.\r\n\r\nThe Dragon-Dog who basked, was roused from her sleep, and I said to her, \"Old one, what is your advice on the matter of the war?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can swallow fifty men,\" she replied.\r\n \r\n\"Indeed,\" said I, \"that will be useful, if the invaders confront us. What say you Snake?\"\r\n\r\nThe Snake changed from circle to line, and shuffled out from his crevice. \r\n\r\n\"I can bite the neck of their leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said I, \"That is fitting. I command you to do so forthwith.\"\r\n\r\nI swung my sword upward, and a sparkle danced upon it.
codex.b5ce88a81de3b97aaa19ca4b45e3e0f7=Once the Snake had bitten the neck of the prince of Gondola, I visited the city. I brought the Crane with me, in the hope he could answer any difficult questions, but I left the Dragon-Dog behind for fear she would terrify. I brought the Mouse for comfort, and to remember what it is to love.\r\n\r\n\"Empress, the Prince is dead. He was poisoned. We are sure you already know, since you were behind it,\" said the leader of the angry mob.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious. The Prince was murdered and you stand to gain from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not deny I would stand to gain,\" I said, \"but what evidence do you have of a crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Prince was bitten by a Snake. You are well-known as a keeper of Snakes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Crane whispered in my ear.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" I replied, \"I keep Snakes, just as I keep one of every animal under the sun. See my Crane, my Mouse. Remember the Dragon-Dog who claims the heads of unbelievers. Revere me here, just as they do in Ten-Rui, and all the great many wards in-between.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, the Gondolese fell silent. They admired my powers of reasoning, guilty or not, and felt they could answer to no other.
codex.2966879bca7d98cb4bd25a834648f86f=In Gondola, I claimed Ten-Rui was mine to rule. This was a lie Crane advised me to tell.\r\n\r\n\"Crane, why say that Ten-Rui is with us, when it is not? We are people of the soil, Ten-Rui stands upon rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rock breeds hard-hearts, but Ten-Rui can be yours to command. Only you, Empress, have the power to seize that city. I have seen it. In your garden, the flies stand and skate upon the pond, without ever sinking below the water.\r\n\r\n\"Very good Crane,\" I said, \"leave me to my Mouse.\" \r\n\r\nAnd so Crane left his perch upon my balcony, and glid out to the reedbank, where he waited for his small prey, the stupid silver-skin fish. 
codex.0cb0a3eda1ac6a1940dcb25b6923ffdb=I saddled the Dragon-Dog, and took her to the gates of Ten-Rui. Behind me were the braves of Wellah, a tenth of the militia who opposed us. But I lifted the sword aloft, and the light danced upon it.\r\n\r\n\"I can swallow fifty men,\" said the Dragon-Dog, and she gallivanted through a strip of the city brigade. I clung tight, swinging my blade left to right. I could not see for the crash of metal, the blood and the flesh. When the Dragon-Dog had come to a halt, I saw our enemy lay down their arms.\r\n\r\n\"Take our city, Empress of the soil.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"do not fear me. I only wish for you to be happy. I have come to take this city, because it is rife with thieves and brigands, and ruled by those who trample upon the poor. The moment I take this city,  I return it back to you.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, the black cloud cleared from over them, and we toasted the fallen with wine and song. For a full month I let Mouse have pride of place, as I took the throne, and rebuilt it in my image, with green, the beautiful green of pasture as my colour. Then, when enough time had passed, I set a bright young man in it who I asked to rule, and I returned to Wellah.
codex.8870dfcad104f11812f41823b5bfc1c8=It was only ten years that passed before the Crane came to me at the balcony, and said, \"My lady. The city of Ten-Rui is rotten again.\" \r\nThus I was bound to return and commit my rule more forcefully. \r\n\"I can swallow fifty men,\" said the Dragon-Dog, and once more I rode through the militia, and once more the men who were not gored, surrendered. \r\n\r\nI found the bright young man I had given the throne, but at first I did not recognise him. He had become a bloated, selfish man, and I fed him to the Crane. Having wiped the blood from his bill, the Crane said, \"This will not do, Empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do to stop a second rotting?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"We must speak to the Snake.\"
codex.92886cf6294149505bf3b71d1f89bcc2=And so once I had spoken to the Snake, a young lady of my choosing took the throne at Ten-Rui. We retired to Wellah to rest. The sharp little Mouse who gives us sight gathered corn, so as to feed the people of that town.\r\n\r\nWe knew that there would be another rotting at Ten-Rui. This time it took only five years for the young lady to disappoint. Her subjects starved while the rich made merry. But Snake had been there all along, watching and waiting. The Snake bit her dead, and all of her courtiers, so that no evil remained at the court of Ten-Rui but the Snake himself. \r\n\r\nA new ruler was elected by lot, and having power, proceeded to abuse it. So the Snake bit him too. The people were by now so afraid of the slippery ribbon that they were forever after careful in power, being both judicious and wise.

Why d'you 'urt me so!\"\n\nHe sought the wise woman, but she would not let him near. She threw stones at him from her roof until he'd cleared off. Then he tried waiting it out, hoping the pain would desist, but it didn't. Bogvik rubbed at his mouth with sticky tar, but as with so many of his problems, that didn't help either. \n\n\"Wicked toof, I must have 'ee out!\" he moaned in despair.\n\nBogvik tried his good hammer, which was useful for everything. But once he fit it in his mouth, there was no room to give it a swing.\n\nAt his wits' end, he donned his cloak and blundered into Darnik. Though his hood was up and his ribbons tight, he couldn't conceal his true nature. On the busy boardway, the crowd frantically parted, some diving into the lagoon to escape. \n\n\"It's Bogvik! Run!\" They yelped.\n\n\"No, I'm not Bogvik!\" he cried, pulling his cloak over his face, \"it's not me!\"
codex.0d18951f1bdd11c4e7a18f0362a20216=Inside the dental surgery, Mr. Andvik maintained his professional reverie. He clipped, and threaded, knapped and bristled. Then finally, he stepped back to admire his handiwork.\n\n\"Thank you Mrs. Reynard, that's all done now.\"\n\"Oh thank you Mr. Andvik, I'm extremely grateful, I really am. They said you were the best around.\"\n\"I'm the only one around, so it's a lucky thing I'm the best,\" he gleamed. \nMrs. Reynard squelched up her face, politely indulging Mr.Andvik his little joke, and made her way to the door. But before she could reach for the handle, she doubled to the floor as if struck in the back by a brick. She clamped her hand over her nose, gasping.\n\"Ohh!\" she cried, \"It is abhorrent.\"\n\"Goodness me, are you alright?\" said Mr.Andvik.\n\"The smell, the smell! The terrible smell!\"\n\"What kind of smell?\" said Mr.Andvik with bright curiosity.\nMrs. Reynard gagged several times while Mr.Andvik waited for her to answer. Eventually Mrs. Reynard, whose head was nearly touching the floor, twisted her neck to look at Mr.Andvik one last time before passing out. Mr.Andvik was considering what to do with her, when there was a knock at the door.
codex.0094cb77672b50ce198b29d6425d6c24=\"Come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be warn'd. It is me Bogvik,\" said the weary voice.\r\n\r\nMr. Andvik opened the door, and looked up and down at the squat fellow who'd been pressed against it. He was dishevelled, with large green eyes, and Mr. Andvik speculated he must be one of the deep Marsha. \r\n\r\n\"Bogvik?\" said Mr. Andvik, \"Should I have heard the name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Bogvik, pleased to find someone fresh and new, someone who didn't judge him on smell alone, \"No, no. Only m' name, is all.\"\r\n\r\nBogvik stared shyly down at the wooden floor. He noticed Mrs. Reynard there, and for a moment he began to worry, but Mr. Andvik seemed in control of the situation and that was all that mattered. He looked up at him and smiled again.   \r\n \r\n\"Can I help you at all, Bogvik?\" said Mr. Andvik.\r\n\r\n\"Oh right.\" said Bogvik, as if taken by surprise, \"Yes. Yes. It's my wicked toof, it 'urts me terrible rotten.\"
codex.02a5995b2d29b038794d6c04d591e17c=\"Rotten indeed!\" said Mr. Andvik, as he removed a piece of enamel from the broad froggy mouth with customary care. Bogvik lay back relaxed, happy that he had help with his problems.\r\n \"And are you alright Mrs. Reynard?\" said Mr. Andvik, not looking up from his work. \r\n\r\nMrs. Reynard roused herself and got to her feet. Still holding her nose she exited the surgery without further correspondence. Bogvik eyed his saviour happily. \r\n\"Are you not...'avin any difficulties with my musk?\" he said, through the brace that held his jaw apart. \r\n\"You mean your terrible smell? No, not at all. Happily, or unhappily, I lost that sense when I was a small boy. I bumped on the boom of a boat whilst fishing, and since that day I have smelled nothing, not even the honkiest cheese.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Bogvik, \"That is sad. You must miss the aroma of hot ogball, or delicious eels cooked on a griddle. But for me, I'm glad, since you can ease my toof's distress, without having t' smell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about poor old everyone else!\" said Andvik, not knowing how sensitive Bogvik was on the matter.
codex.fd518c588bf329267af99994c1bffd49=A guilty look passed by Bogvik's face. He thought of all the people of Darnik he had offended, or injured, like Mrs. Reynard. He dwelt on such things, because they guaranteed his loneliness.\r\n\r\n\"Have you considered, perhaps, that it was your tooth all along? A case of halitosis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Bogvik, excited by the dentist's theory.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it may only be a part of your problem,\" Andvik said, dabbing the inside of Bogvik's mouth with a moist cloth, \"Of course, I won't be able to tell if anything changes, once I've fixed you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must see a lot of mouth,\" said Bogvik.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly why my condition is a blessing,\" said Mr. Andvik. With that, he ushered Bogvik out the chair, and Bogvik gave him money for his trouble.\r\n\r\n\"You are a very good man,\" said Bogvik, tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no need, no need,\" said Mr. Andvik. \"Safe travels.\"
codex.24cce9d9fab849e96780e68acb0e3a3c=It had been evident as soon as Bogvik left the dental practice, that nothing had changed vis-a-vis his odour. People were clambering over one another to get out of his path. He put this down to the dental treatment not having fully taken effect, and wended merrily back to the deep Marsha believing life was worth living again.\r\n\r\nImagine his despair then, when he returned to Darnik a few days later, only to find \r\nThe revulsion unabated. \r\n\r\n\"Oh god. Oh holy frogspawn, get it away from me!\"\r\n\r\nBogvik panicked and dove into the lagoon, and planned to swim away, back to the deep Marsha, when he heard a familiar voice.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait, dear Bogvik.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Andvik.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Andvik!\" said Bogvik, at first pleased to see him, but then turning suddenly angry. \r\n\r\n\"You said I wouldn't smell!\"\r\n\r\n\"I said nothing of the sort. I said your tooth might be one of the reasons for a smell. Besides, you came to me because your tooth hurt. Does it hurt now? If not then I've done my job.\"\r\n\r\nBogvik let the water sluice dismally in and out of his mouth.
codex.f8cc04d246b2024d5479ef99dde57fcb=\"Wait a minute Bogvik, what are those?\" said Mr. Andvik, pointing to a continuous stream of bubbles agglomerating near the lagoon's surface, \"Is that...wind? Bogvik, can you move a little to your right?\"\r\n\r\nBogvik did as he was told. The bubbles followed him.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness me, that must be it,\" laughed Mr. Andvik, \"what on earth do you eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mostly the frog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marshan Flatus Frog?!\" \r\n\r\n\"Is that what 'ee call 'em? Lovely they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are well-known for their usefulness in winter. They fill up on marsh gas, and serve as excellent kindling. But they aren't for eating! Indeed, I daresay that is the primary source of your troubles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" said Bogvik, \"but I have always eaten the frogs, I'm used to 'em now. I love 'em on a spit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might well do, but I'm not sure your body agrees. If you were to give them up, perhaps you'd be free of the bad smell once and for all.\"
codex.344a9b9c4f72d6fa8379ca2ab57f3e20=Bogvik sunk underwater for a few moments. It was the best time for thinking clearly, especially in the summer when the water was warm. Just as Mr. Andvik began to worry, Bogvik surfaced. \r\n\r\n\"I have thought on what 'ee say. I have consulted the marsh-below-the-marsh. It be true, my life is riddled with worry; do I smell? don't I smell?-\"\r\n\r\n\"-you definitely smell,\" said a passer-by.\r\n\r\n\"-but giving up those tasty frogs would destroy a bigger part of me. I don't want to lose that just to please others. Ee'll just have to accept me as I am, or not at all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that Bogvik swam away. Of course, he would never be accepted him in the town of Darnik, and he never had occasion to meet with the kindly Mr. Andvik again, but after that day, he learned to truly accept who he was. Never again would mocking laughter and disgust go any distance with him.\r\n\r\nAnd up in the clouds, a long-legged crane drifted about on the breeze.
codex.4d6240b2634befd4c6673e850187cdc7=I don't know how long it had been going on, by then. But when I first spotted the small huddle of workers at the southwest corner of the Darat camp, at the blind spot where the bending palms obscure a kink in the fence, I froze.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I didn't sound the alarm, I just watched. I waited to see who, or what was drawing them there. I recognised the shrivelled pot-bellied Tepes, one of the Goners, and some others. I could have sworn they were talking with someone beyond the fence.  \r\n\r\nA colleague appeared from the elevator to relieve me of duty. I knew if he saw what I saw, he'd report me. I distracted him with card talk, and when I next snuck a glance at the kink in the fence, I saw that the Bandinians had returned to the exercise yard.
codex.18375367cf041e9d8fa3421c1f308b4f=I went down to the mess room, and picked up a hot vittles, and guilty bowl of corn. Guilty, because every time I lifted the spoon to my mouth, I thought how much more others needed it. Those slaves at the fence. That's probably what they were doing there, but who was giving them food?\r\n\r\nI went to command, and I said, \"Commander, I really like the view from South Tower, I'd like to continue duty there, if possible. The bracing desert wind brings me closer to god.\"\r\nHe grunted. I had invoked an old promise that barely held any sway these days.\r\n\"If you must,\" he said, \"speak to the dutyman.\" \r\nAs I closed the door to his office, I heard the radio warble to life, and his feet prop up on a chair.
codex.cdace21c647073368fb57b22bbe75310=I had to wait several weeks before I saw the phenomenon again - the little crowd of slaves gathered at the kink in the fence. I nearly lost my mind with excitement, so dreary was everything else. I deserted my post, taking the lift down to the compound level, and making my way, as quietly as I could, to a vantage point behind the palms. \r\n\r\nThere was muttering. \"Pale Fox...\" I thought I heard one whisper. \r\n\r\nThe group had broken away from the fence, but I could see they had something in their hands. It looked like fruit pulp. Someone was smuggling fruit pulp through the fence.\r\n\r\nI should have reported it then too, but I didn't. I pretended to myself I was building up a catalogue of evidence to lay out in front of the commander.
codex.089344ed80b8deb971756fed233978ea=It was early morning, a good hour before dawn. I yawned. It had been a dull night's watch. As always I'd kept my eyes on the kink in the fence, waiting for something.\r\n\r\nThen I saw him. Pale Fox. An apparition catching the lens of my binoculars. The outline of a being, hunched, his face strangely crooked.\r\n\r\nThe figure was so still, that after some time I began to doubt if it was anything more than moonshadow. But as the first ray of sunlight arced over the land, the grainy figure stood prouder against the sand, I could see his feral mask. \r\n\r\nSuddenly he twitched, and for a few moments stared straight at me. Then he shot away into the scrubland.
codex.753e6c2e99a9dfe63ec6724da8059d2f=After that he grew bolder. He came to the fence at quiet times, when he knew there was no-one else on duty but me.\r\n\r\nWe observed one another curiously. He must have wondered what I'd let him get away with, how far he'd be allowed to go before I betrayed him. \r\n\r\nI noticed he had stopped meeting the slaves to give them food, and it wasn't hard to guess he had something more ambitious planned.\r\n\r\nOne night, he went north of the kink in the fence to another spot, not far from the western gate. As he slipped between the perimeter fence and the back of the storehouse, he turned back to look at me. I pointed to my eyes, then towards the western watchtower, to let him know they would be watching. Then I sliced under my neck to imply it would be dangerous.\r\nHe paused, nodded, and darted on.  \r\n\r\nI was complicit in it now. I was a traitor.
codex.4882c4230453a4650266809215cfaf78=I was expecting to hear the siren at any moment, or the gun towers pounding, as they did at even the slightest rattle of the perimeter fence. But there was only stillness. That is the way Pale Fox is.\r\n\r\nHe is a messiah. It doesn't matter who is behind the mask. He wants to bring balance back - to renew love - and he wants nothing for his efforts. That's why when he asked for more help, I willingly gave it. \r\n\r\nThe evening of the breakout, he appeared at the fence in the usual place to give the crowd instructions. My radio buzzed.\r\n\r\n\"South Watchtower, all ok your side? We've lost visibility on over half the group.\"\r\n\r\n\"All ok, West Tower. We are god.\" \r\n\r\nThe crowd of slaves were looking up at me. One man bowed low, but another pulled him back up. I would remain the enemy until they were safely escaped. Only then they would remember me. Pale Fox looked up at me again. He pointed toward the west gate, then held up an imaginary radio to his face. \r\n\r\nI nodded.
codex.1d819c24bea3eaf6148e79327f5d20e8=I knew it would begin not long after the start of my shift. There were more than usual in the exercise yard as I looked out across the camp, and to the left where the kink in the fence was, Pale Fox stood stock still. I felt just as nervous as him. \r\n\r\nHe looked to me, and gave me a countdown on one hand. At zero, I called the inspector at West Gate. \r\n\r\n\"Oh hello Inspector, it's South Gate Watchtower here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\nI gulped.\r\n\r\n\"The commander wants to see you in his office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really? What, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he said right away. We are god.\"\r\n\r\nI watched him step out of the booth and wander back along the line to West Gate, he put his angel into the machine, and the barrier rose. He pointed his gun at the nearby slaves, who backed away. Then the gate lowered behind him. For a moment I worried he would shortcut through the back section where Pale Fox was waiting, but he took the longer, more established route.\r\n\r\nThe escapees wouldn't have long.
codex.50e7cad8245de84f387e7e6b83f91a3e=At my signal, Pale Fox dashed off into the scrub, then I saw him return at speed through the tunnel to the booth, where he whipped a spare angel key and jammed it into the gate machine. \r\n\r\nHe looked at me again. \r\n\r\n\"West Tower, this is South Tower. The commander is on his way over. He wants those surveys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks South Tower.\"\r\n\r\nI swung my binoculars to West Tower. The guard was in the elevator, heading to the archive. I raised and lowered my arm quickly. Pale Fox began ushering the Bandinians out through the gap between the fence and the storehouse. They only had to run across open ground for a few feet before they got to the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, who are you signalling to?\" shouted the inspector, who was standing outside the commander's office. When I didn't reply, he ran inside. I waved frantically at Pale Fox, and he drove the slaves out at greater speed. \r\n\r\n\"Sound the alarm!\" cried the commander, putting his mantle over his shoulders, and looking up to my tower in disgust.
codex.5feb048862f6b9961c04a241c7bea4eb=The gun towers swiveled and opened fire. The first volley took down a strip of slaves. The gates went into lockdown, but by then Pale Fox's people were already through. They scattered into the night, each running in a different direction. I heard the echoes of whoops of joy. \r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes, a search party had gathered at the drill square. They were wrapped up for dust storms and armed with heavy weapons. A bunch of them would take low-flying catboats. They'd pick up the odd straggler, but the majority, the vast majority, would make it. I grinned. The weather was favourably chaotic, and the desert was full of trapholes and places to wait it out. Then it wasn't far to the river, to follow it north to the uplands, or south to Driss and out to sea on an old-fashioned boat. \r\n\r\nOnce the search party had set out, I went to the commander's empty office and sat in his chair. I flicked on the radio, and heard the broadcast. \r\n\r\n\"One hundred have escaped from Darat mine. If you are in the area, remain on alert.\"\r\nI tuned over to some Bandinian cymbal music. That was more like it. I rooted through the commander's drawer and found a bottle of schnockel he hadn't declared - seems we all have our foibles. Mine is the emancipation of the oppressed. It feels like I'm saving my soul, and after a couple of swigs of firewater, I really start to feel golden. I feel like a god for the first time in my life. I get a pen and start writing.
codex.5b7727200e7b5bc0700c3a9518f1d96a=I bound this compendium with the intention of accounting for the many fallen men and women, that fall both within and beyond my own understanding of the word \"heroism\". Some were friends, some enemies. Some were well-known, some little-known, and some not known to me at all. For the latter, I have had to use my imagination, along with the accounts of the survivors I met at Capulca, who have offered up their own recollections. \r\n\r\nMy personal interpretation of the words \"hero\" and \"heroine\" sit in the context of The Hole - the disappearance (allow me to believe it) of everyone I knew and loved. I feel like a coward, still alive when they're not. I therefore dedicate this volume to those that gave their lives prematurely, in defence of shared values (however alien some may seem to you).\r\n\r\nYou will not find here the best-known individuals of the age, but rather, those who relished their anonymity.Those who proudly raised the banners of their clans and marched towards certain doom. 
codex.337b67565413e0f882946c21c65ebcd5=1. Albodan Rangers\r\nThere wasn't a great deal for a young person to do in the town of Albodan, whose greatest excitement was to catch a glimpse of passing convoys on their way to somewhere more interesting. But what better distraction for delinquents than to take pot-shots at moving targets in the hope of improving their aim?\r\nRangers of Albodan were among the first called upon by Empress Tangana when the Stone War began. She and Gloam were said to have been impressed by the Rangers' disregard for rules and regulations, not to mention their fine tracking and survival skills. Once the recruits were sworn-in, they were presented with silver-brimmed helms, an act which many speculated was political. It was not often that the ruler bestowed a gift upon those less privileged.  
codex.ac81f18ad8dd7bd9286223ae8b635130=2. Bandits of Birikoi\r\nBirikoi was widely regarded as the most impoverished locale in all Foundation. A grimy, crap-stained conurbation, in which very few of the inhabitants were able to read. By the time of the occupation, the place was overrun with godhands, dragging batches of locals off to the mines. But so often standing in their way, as they hung from the rafters, or poked their noses from trapdoors, was a plague of bandits. These armed thieves frequently mustered along the road to Driss in ambush. Not content just to mug the godhands, they freed any slaves as well. It is that selfless gesture that earns them a place in my compendium.
codex.a7c71290fa1bf58655c2b921bc9498d6=3. Owl Guard - Empress' Bodyguards \r\nThe Owl Guard had but one duty; to act as bodyguards for the Empress wherever she went. Given she seldom went anywhere, much of the Owls' time was spent idling at court, waiting for something to happen. But things did sometimes happen. For example, the day nine Owls gave their lives to prevent a wayward Dragon-Dog from blowing up the entire court. Though fifty died that day, it could have been much worse. \r\nIn the final battle, they loyally followed their Empress to the frontline against Sabor. The Owl Guard were hallowed, and they were dependable.
codex.0e0a4f9601b402dd1b0082043907c430=4. Essedari Gymnothrusters\r\nMuch as it pains me to include a cohort of Saborians in this compendium, the Essedari belong as much to our lost world as anything else, and I wrote this book because I miss that place. \r\nThe Saborian Essedari were extraordinarily skilled athletes, who made best use of their mobility to speed between ships. They used \"Gymnothrusters\", a backpack device I don't pretend to understand, to fly in and among their adversaries. During the Stone War they were everywhere, giving their side a great tactical advantage. Blinded by the promise of Aetherium, the Essedari were also fearless in hand-to-hand combat.
codex.a02d36ec920de18c7a0fad0c081598f2=5. Larks of Lower Karem\r\nThe Ishgiruan preoccupation with birds found itself another channel in the cult of Larks. The Larks were a well-prepared and experienced group who, much like the bird, rose early in the morning to prepare for battle with choral song. Once battle began they were rather different, preferring to wade heavily in aboard large and well-armoured frigates. They blazed and blasted their way through the enemy. They were still hanging on at the last battle of the Stone War, according to my Karemese friends in Capulca.
codex.3a951040c87162bbca8ee6ebaebd9ae4=6. Flying Aces of Bargu Jiu\r\nMany people have forgotten that the Mellifluans had any kind of military force. But the flying corps of Bargu Jiu were undoubtedly the best producers of pilots in Foundation, even as their homeland was falling apart. The environment that bred these daredevils was unique; internecine rivalry fuelled by drink and marital jealousy. Bargu Jiu aces often took to the skies sozzled, and used to remark that their best moves could only be performed when under the influence. In the final days of Foundation, the aces could be found among the ranks of both sides, though they were such mavericks, I am skeptical about how useful they might have been.
codex.0c4b549c140e75f45db6d3cb2a6e5992=7. Fasio Fuzileers \r\nThe importance of a land army shouldn't be understated, particularly when Atlas is at stake. A disorganised rabble, the Fasio Fuzileers were proud, with the unique ability to come together when it mattered, even if outnumbered. They were hardy soldiers who were able to deal with the chill winds of north Chabuti, and to protect their nation right to the very last. The Fuziliers answered to the fourth Ephor of Chabuti - the one designated Martial General - and played an important defensive role in the contest for the Korchis Mountains versus the Mellifluans.
codex.45f039696979d868f6167c6def42b119=8. Drummers of Ternanu\nThe drummers of Ternanu were an ill-equipped and ill-disciplined soldiery, but they took so much joy from their drumming that it didn't matter. Sadly, a fabulous tempo and the unmatched synchronisation of their drill squares did nothing for their combat prowess. They were quickly overpowered by the Saborian army during their acquisition of Melliflua's mining reserves. Whether they were foolhardy or fully aware of their inferiority is not recorded, but I'm sure they made a great rumpus on those drums. Giving their lives selflessly for something they enjoyed, they remain among my favourite heroes of Foundation.
codex.643ae85b15459ad15525adc8862d41e7=9. Wolf Scouts\r\nIn the far north, where the ice floes extended endlessly towards the midnight sun, the Tarrery lived nomadic and isolated, for tens of thousands of years. One day they saw the first skyships hovering overhead, and to them it must have seemed mere moments later that these foreigners were taking bites out of their land. Imhorta, wolf mother was angered. Fortunately Imhorta had chosen some Tarrery for a gift at birth; a tiny droplet of mucous from her nose. Those with the gift were able to smell far ahead, to discover parts of the tundra that were still untouched by the invaders, on which their families could still live.
codex.f96c2df6a62af06dfeef6a3fc963122c=10. Olayinka's Crew\r\nI have no personal experience of Olayinka's crew, and that can only be a good thing. Olayinka's Crew took on the illegal bounties that were posted in Ten-Rui's low-town by the rich. The Mercantile Authority turned a blind eye to the odd assassination, so Olayinka's Crew were free to operate as they wished. They'd be protected by their former clients, at least until those clients became bounties themselves. Once he had you, Olayinka liked to tie you up, dead or alive, for delivery. Why are Olayinka and his crew heroes? They gave opportunities to young people, and if you think that's a bad thing, you don't know how low life in the low-town could be.
codex.004961746bb5e686134ada6e349e0710=11. The Peculiar Five \r\nThe supply of dried fish from the sea up to high Huacanado was big business, and the Peculiar Five had to step in to break the monopoly that Garcia held over the city. Mendes was the charismatic leader, Bovo the quiet one, Negares the brains, Sainz the quickest on the draw, and Hurtado the violent one. It was their gunslinging that would bring Garcia to justice, as they made holes in his mountain villa. Rumour has it Hurtado scraped the skin off Garcia with a pound of his own dried fish. Evidently brutal, the Peculiar Five were legendary among Pin, since they slung in the grey space between good and evil.
codex.1c5a0b84519968fa15d89db266ae4ecf=12. Stalkers\r\nGri-Liif, Queen of the Shamoe is a name I have heard whispered. Not only a queen of her tribe, but also the most committed guardian of their heritage. Rather than enter direct conflicts they could not hope to win, the Shamoe tribe melted into their environment, and snuck up to their foes. The most able were known as Stalkers. They watched and waited, and used their knowledge of jungle toxins to immobilise enemies from the shadows. They allied with the Daughters of Hatep - covered later in this volume - to keep prospectors away from Koinos at the end of Foundation. The Pekoe at Capulca say the actions of the Gri-Liif and the Stalkers saved humanity from a worse fate than has since befallen us, though I cannot imagine what that could possibly be.
codex.d7f8fb549b37eb28edc9b4104902c007=13. House of Wings \r\nThe elite pilots of the House of Wings were purists. Their ships were equipped with the bare minimum; no telescopes, no guns, no armour. Their advantage was the agility of their ships, leading merry dances, and causing opposing ships to collide in their wake. Despite this, the Wings were highly successful in the Stone War, some allying with the Kioki, some the Saborians. Pilots of the House of Wings wore next to nothing, applying the same rigid principles to their dress as they did to their warfare. For showing character, I dub them heroes.
codex.433492ba97c7dfacff428fc5bc5556bb=14. Goatbearers\r\nIf you wanted to trap critters in my homeland, the Pintin mountains, you wanted to find a Goatbearer. These trappers were named after the elusive goatbear, a creature so mysterious none could prove its existence, let alone catch one. But salmon, monkeys, birds - you name it, these rigging-clad old duffers knew how to find and bait them. \r\nNo matter how well-prepared they were, a couple of trappers went missing every year. Their associates would search low and high, before declaring, \"he's gone to their kingdom, the Goatbears will make him their king.\" 
codex.27bebfc822459e4d15dbd866304fe948=15. Silver Arrows\r\nBeyond the Apotheon, and up beyond the habitations of Agbana was a mast that hemmed and hawed in the breeze. This was the launchpad of the Silver Arrows, a gliding squadron who were commissioned to fly in dazzling formations. They were rarely deployed in live combat, being better suited to victory parades and celebrations, but when called upon during the Stone War, the Silver Arrows answered. Having no engines on their gliders, they had to carefully manage their altitude in order to avoid dropping below the clouds, but it made them adept at landing stealthily on enemy vessels. They were so effective that us Kioki designated \"silver arrow spotters\" on our vessels to watch overhead.
codex.c4b8d4ab2d258ccb0b2931988153cc22=16. People of the Mist\r\nAnyone who travelled west of Sabor, or east of the Green Islands will know that there was nothing beyond but the endless ocean. It took steely nerve and smart use of ship instruments not to get lost, what with the strange readings many reported. Odder still, were stories of a sea-peoples who appeared at the far fringes. Accounts agree that they had skyships, and that these ships were as comfortable submerged in water as they were in the clouds. The extent of their kingdom is not known, but anyone that chanced to drift near it would find themselves followed. When observed through a spyglass, the pursuing ship, which tacked and changed course expertly so as to remain cautiously distant, appeared to be shrouded in mist. As such, no clue about its people or technology could be discerned. Thus these shrewd and mysterious navigators were dubbed, \"People of the Mist\".
codex.de4d189510e6b5b4a416128547a11d01=17. Sappers\r\nThe Sappers of Strombiu were no more than a bunch of renegade miners, who, frustrated by the thinly-veiled exploitation of Chabuti by the Unity, decided to turn on their own government. The Ephors were renowned for their corruption, and had been selling off Chabuti land to Kioki consortia, land that was being heavily mined to fuel Kioki's war with Sabor. The Sappers got their revenge by sabotaging mining facilities with their explosive charges. When Chabuti fell, they took their explosives ship-to-ship instead, swinging their way aboard with their fireaxes. Though they naively sided with the Saborians (as if they were any better) in the war, I still regard them among the bravest.
codex.7532682925e1fc8e1dd44ccf50099413=18. Foresters\r\nThe Foresters of Qahvzin preferred to be left alone, but the miners kept arriving from south Karem and Ishgiru. They cut down row upon row of trees to make space for Atlas treatment works, and the skyways to transport it. One famous story reminds us how cunning the foresters could be. When deforestation of Qahvzin was at its worst, the woodsmen devised a scheme to rid the town of its invaders once and for all. They collected bucketfuls of rosehip fruit, and picked them apart for the seeds. Then they dried them out and sprinkled them all over the miner's overalls at night. Of course that made the overalls terribly itchy, and by the end of the working day, the miners had scratched themselves red raw. On their return to town, the foresters made sure to cry, \"it's goner's disease, spread to Karem!\" The miners looked at one another, and seeing the weals and sores, made a complaint to the mercantile authority, and the authority duly closed the mines.
codex.d7e16fc943c35fb26a8a668df522c814=19. The Hollow Men\nThe Holo Men were a band of sovnya-wielding mercenaries from the quiet Chabuti city of Holo in the far north. They swore allegiance to whomever could pay their exorbitant fee. Onlookers said they fought like machines, rigidly violent, and that they never saw their faces for the black grilles that covered them. They were \"shapes without form, shades without colour\", and thus became better-known as the Hollow Men. In the Stone War they fought on the side of Sabor, as they had asked to be paid in feldspar crystals, which only Sabor possessed. It is not known what the Hollow Men intended to do with them, once the war ended.
codex.b627ec790f90dbce5ce564058848d799=20. House of the Iris\r\nOf all those who tried to scope the entirety of Foundation, and to prove that it was not kite-shaped or flat (as was popularly held before the Hole opened up), the House of the Iris had the greatest success. They were explorers who craved danger and the unknown. In a golden age in which all had what they wanted, this was a sensation. Skimming out to the far extremities of the map, they recorded everything in detail, as is the Verduban way. The House of the Iris discovered many islands, new peoples and curiosities. They were always easily recognised, since each member of the house wore a human iris on their person.
codex.86e5371ad0ca1e996077fc2f6cf8b97d=21. Paupers\r\nThe Ten-Rui Paupers were, for a time, among the most celebrated of all heroes. The list of official Paupers numbers less than fifty names, but they represented the impossible - the faint chance a vagrant could win Ten-Rui's famous stilt race. Being the single most important event of the year, every Nabob worth their salt sponsored an athlete. As solo competitors in the stilt races, with no team to support them, the poor had little hope. Would-be Paupers often had to borrow stilts with loans they could not possibly hope to repay, unless of course, they were to win. For every thousand who lost their lives or suffered debtors miseries as a result of the stilt races, there was one, who by skill or good fortune, managed to succeed. The Mercantile Authority and the Empress would reluctantly bless that Pauper's triumph, knowing that disputing it might cause unrest. Nevertheless, Paupers received a crown more modest than would have been given a competitor from the guilds. Some would argue the simplicity of the Pauper's crown made it all the more beautiful, the victory all the sweeter.
codex.58a04b436d0bce1a1662d85ccf3a2984=22. Red Ribbons \r\nThe bays of the Vinicotian islands of Nicobocar, Samoval and Jinty were well-known for their ne'erdowells. Any old inn might turn up a cross-section of knaves; ruffians, thieves, buccaneers. But you wouldn't have sighted a red ribbon there for all the money that lay at the bottom of the sea. You see, the Red Ribbons were smugglers, and smart smugglers don't give themselves away. But what is there to life I hear you ask, if one cannot leave one's mark? That is how the ribbons came to be, for these smugglers tied the little red ribbon around all of their contraband as a reminder to those who would cross them. Rumour has it they wore rings and ribbons upon their bodies too, though they were seldom seen to prove it.
codex.4c43854f9051a4d7996eaccd9ba662a2=23. The Sons of Kip\r\nIn the valleys of Ishgiru near Gondola, lay a mighty fortress. Kip's Keep was one of the many homes of the legendary 'true Empress' of Ishgiru. It was also home to the Sons of Kip, worshippers of the small moon. They vowed to defend the true Empress with their cranequins. \r\nMillennia later, and the order of the Sons of Kip remained, but their patron was no more. Without an income, Kip's Keep had ruined. The Sons of Kip were proud, and would not disband, so they agreed to pledge allegiance to others for a fee. That way they could preserve Kip's Keep proud traditions - only males could join the Sons of Kip, and had to remain celibate. Needless to say, any mercenaries proficient with ranged weapons are useful in skyship combat, and moreover the Sons of Kip deserved their reputation for unflappable excellence.
codex.7f5376942272ad852f4fb7a2885fd4b4=24. The Daughters of Hatep\r\nSince the Sons of Kip did not allow women to join their ranks, I feel it only right to mention the Daughters of Hatep, who I'd say were more heroic still. The Daughters were the chosen huntresses of the Tamoe tribe, and were required to give up their womanhood for a life of hunting. No men could align with Lord Hatep, King of Serpents. \r\nIt was at the beginning of this, the 4th Millennium, that the Daughters were entreated by the Shamoe tribe to help them deter prospectors sniffing around Koinos, wondering if there was Atlas to be had. The Daughters of Hatep were excellent trackers, and understood well the movement of the astral bodies. They tipped their arrows with sleeping medicine, and having put prospectors to sleep, turned their ships around and set them off in the opposite direction.
codex.997aacda57e43cfcd9d2821d30152143=25. The Cudgels of the Black Tabard. \r\nWe are more credulous of the stranger things now than we once were. In particular, the existence of people physiologically different to us. I remember people of Ten-Rui claiming they had met a ratwoman come to sell her inventions in the low-town. Then there is the old Saborian legend of the Queen of the ratpeople. Well, believe it or not I once met a man named Marinello, who claimed to have seen thousands upon thousands of them. He said they lived in the Wahsili, a distance from the lighter of the lamps, their sacred pylon, and that they fought terrifying battles underground. Well, I have it on good authority that those battles Marinello described were a sham - a ceremonial conflict. Nevertheless I have saved a place in this book for the cudgeling rats, since I believe their very existence in such a cruel and unforgiving place as Foundation deserves our respect and gratitude.
codex.55af6575fd5300bf0c88a1d43f287350=26. Hawks of Karem\r\nThe Hawks of Karem were of proud heritage, a band of South Karemese from the plains near Tomahon, they were known for their tactical nous, especially in ship manoeuvres - like the hawk who circles its prey before the kill. \r\nThe hawks would begin battles tethered together, so that they could discuss plans and strategies, but they would quickly separate to take positions as high as they could above the clouds. The Hawks of Karem bred Captains and Admirals who served throughout the Stone War, winning many victories for the Kioki. I won't dwell on the story of Captain Astor of Karem, for he is sufficiently celebrated elsewhere.
codex.c29d08e47320c339b46e106d8d0ffa32=27. Rammybobbles of Mandala\nAs I wander about these islands, collecting wood and other materials, I often find myself whistling. The tunes I whistle are invariably (if I remember rightly) Mellifluan ones. I even know some of the words. \n\n\"Harmony...Sweet Harmony\nLike the bird and bee...\nWoooahahah, give it to me.\"\n\nIt can only be the work of the Rammybobbles. A conclave of poets, bards. In their time, they fought for the right to express themselves, and their voices could often be heard above the confusion that was the Mellifluan government - the cushion-slumped, warble-voiced, streamers of red tape. When I was at Capulca, I met the last of the Rammybobbles, a man named Banton. He spoke lyrically. He did not waste a word. \n\nHe told me that in Mandala, a suburb of Kubo, he and his friends had protested the occupation, associating with Menizes, and the resistance. I found his efforts inspiring.
codex.b756dc68a0f566809a40bd9cf55a6d79=28. Marimbian Sabremasters\r\nI have long since tried to convince the little ones of the existence of mountains. The odd island we pass supports my claim, but nothing has the scale of the Pintins, that shimmering galaxy of peaks in my homeland. \r\nI remember that just short of the highest peak of Tito Bipo, lived the Marimbian Sabremasters. They were ascetics who had renounced worldly pleasures and taken to a simple life of meditation and sabre practice. To see them swish to and fro, was like watching the dragonfly above the pond, gliding weightlessly. Though they were masters with the sword, the monks refused to take sides during the Stone War, believing the Kioki to be greedy, and the Saborians to be misguided zealots. Even as the earth peeled away from itself, the Sabremasters were said to have remained - their respect for the mountains keeping them there.
codex.1b19182831dc86d5b087d71336688222=29. The Cannibals of Vinicoti.\r\nOn the isle of Nicobocar in the Warm Sea, you sometimes saw curious smoke inland. Whenever you went to investigate, the smoke would suddenly vanish. This fueled stories that a hidden city existed, run by native Vinicotians with a taste for human flesh. Those who escaped reported that they wielded curved swords called falcata for the chopping of limbs, and more startling, that the pale-faced cannibals were remarkable builders, and that their elegant houses were, in the Verduban mode, decorated with sculptures of body parts. It is widely believed that Chef Molin was once a visitor. He and his followers came to no harm since the natives were great admirers of his cookery (even if he hadn't worked with human flesh before). Ultimately the Cannibals were simple folk, whose eating habits were taboo - but hardly surprising given the paucity of other edible mammals on the isles. The meaning of survival has changed in the aspect of a new world, and it's safe to say I have never understood the Vinicoti Cannibals better.
codex.c175768eccd3e3013c545469d585e088=30.The Flying Panthers\r\nAlmost all auxiliaries fighting for the Kioki Unity in the Stone War were in the pay of the Empress. It was the only way to be sure of convincing people to fight. Most weren't worried about the earthquakes or the threat of Sabor, or the rise to power of the Warlocks, but rather, what food could be put on the table, how high they could build their homes, and what expensive jewellery they could gift their spouses. The more useful you were in a fight, the better wage you would earn, and none earned more than the Flying Panthers. They were all-rounders, without specialism or weakness. They fought well, flew well, and they never gave an inch. For that it would be wrong not to call them heroes. Such was their fame that the children of Ten-Rui could often be seen wearing replica outfits, each emblazoned with the head of the panther.
codex.57c577b91e926bae8a5a9be3880cd7e9=31.The Wahsili Brigands\r\nTourists drifting too far from the crowd near the Lighter of the Lamps might find themselves caught in a web, literally. The Wahsili brigands fashioned webbed nets below the dunes, and covered them over with a loose layer of sand. When unsuspecting victims triggered the trap they'd be unable to move. The brigands would empty their pockets before dumping them somewhere, penniless and confused. Contrary to popular belief, the brigands lived not inland, but along the coast, in towns like Rugik. These small seaports, with their unwelcoming locals and high temperatures were rarely celebrated. But they were as much a part of Foundation, as anything else. Now our home is gone, we understand that even the most trivial lives mattered.
codex.5896624acc3659aa634c5d601714d845=32.The Frogmarshas\r\nIf you told me there was such a thing as a curmudgeonly Deep Marsha before I sat down to write this compendium, I'm not sure I would have believed you. The ones I met always seemed so civil and courteous. But during the Stone War, the Great Marshans looked to Kioki for support. \"What can you offer in return?\" said the Empress Tangana to the famous investigator Puggibun, when he petitioned her to protect his homeland from Sabor. \"I'll ask around,\" he replied.\r\nPuggibun roused the grumpiest, most bitter of all the Deep Marsha, and joined them together under the banner of the \"Frogmarshas,\" an amphibious unit equipped with shock tridents. They were so mean-spirited it made them extremely difficult opponents in combat. They were frontline warriors, who'd jump onto enemy ships and set about their crews, I respect them for that fearlessness.
codex.6bb37a436adf793cc8f4f7add773a116=33. Intucki Firescouts\nIntucki Firescouts let fire blossom along the ropeways between their wooden towers and the broad southern bays of Koinos. When the Twy-Ni-Banda snake slithered up, and wound itself around the platforms, the scouts wafted their flaming torches in the snake's direction. The Intucki were typically brash, wilfully ignorant of the outside world, and too quick to resort to violence. But it could not be said of their Firescouts, who would only attack their enemies if absolutely necessary. \nIn 3012, a small armada arrived in Mejinka bay, looking for Atlas. Like the Intucki themselves, these speculators used fire to fend off the snakes. The scouts devised a cunning scheme to send them away. They poured a mixture of tar and tree-frog poison in circumference around their expedition party, and lit it. The speculators were trapped, and though many made it back to their ships, others suffered dreadful hallucinations; the ghostly masks of the Firescouts leaping among the flames.

Househusbands of Panyana\r\nIt wasn't until late evening that their wives returned from a hard day's work at the university, and they'd have to get dinner on the table. Once the baby or children had gone to bed, then they finally had a bit of 'me' time. But how to stay awake? How to make the most of it? \r\nOne of the Gallish Househusbands had the idea that they'd start an evening class, which would teach the old Gallish discipline of quarterstaff. \r\nThe men would meet in their robes down on the black beaches of Panyana. They'd start off talking about how long it took to teach themselves to milk, or how much teething was hurting their babies. Soon enough though they were up to their knees in sand, battering each other with the long wooden poles. \r\nBy the end, when the University had itself subsided, the Househusbands banded together aboard a ship they had built together in their free time, known as \"The Fathership\". 
codex.2e0866917ad6068418d19123d813b420=35. The Gallish Retinue.\nThe Gallish Liaison Trustees were always certain of the Rebus, an encryption that protected Panyana University's researches. Nevertheless, the magnificently dressed national guard, known as the Retinue, were trained to be the best. With the knowledge of the University to draw upon, these men (and occasionally women) were intelligent, well-equipped fighters. In battle, they would form \"armadillos\" with their shields to defend against enemy weaponry. Since there was no military tradition in Gall to speak of, the Trustees negotiated an exchange with Sabor, which placed the Retinue under severe and rapid training programmes there. The Retinue were just as nimble and light as their Saborian counterparts, and members of the Retinue often did well at the Saborian Aetherial Games. Ultimately, however, the purpose of the Retinue was to defend Gall, and that is exactly what they did.
codex.6849c57975f576de43bf614eae48d1af=36. The Pact of Jinty\r\nJinty hadn't been a popular travel destination since the deafening eruption of its volcano in 2829. It was a smoking-hot isle, and the steady babble of blue lava often formed new chains of islands. In other words, it was the perfect place for a secret tryst. In this case, not lovers, but skysailors. In 2991, at the end of the golden age, fifty-three went there to plot against the Pirate King. Because of the fall in the availability of Atlas, the Pirate King had apparently gone through a bit of a lean spell, and hadn't been very good at paying his men. Of course, he'd made piracy outside of his circle almost impossible, and the fifty-three who met at Jinty were either very brave or very stupid. Each remembered their pact by receiving from their ringleader, a forged steel Xiphos engraved with their vows and a symbol - a pair of interlocked arms.
codex.61180fba0c82801bd821d61c38d64109=37. Warrior Ants \nThe few witnesses there were to the daily lives of the antmen, denizens of the spooky \"Night Lands\", all attested to there being a strict division of duty between civilian and warrior. The warriors, they said, dressed in hard carapaces, and had ant-like helms with long plumes atop them. For weapons they used pairs of jagged silvery scimitars, one in each hand. \"Like an ant's gnashing mandibles,\" or so said a friend at Capulca. He claimed to have seen the antmen fight a plague of the flying Mantas, which erupted from a sinkhole in the mud. Sadly, that was just the beginning, and the Antmen are believed to have been one of the first civilisations to fall when the earthquakes began. I hope that out there somewhere, some of them have survived, even if their spectacular architecture has not.
codex.d13f4548c488f406c750aaee164e8d15=38. Tarrery Bloodclaws\nFew Atlas prospectors lived to speak of the wild-eyed harpoon-toting Tarrery that raided their caravans, turning the ice blood-red. What they may not have known, is that these seemingly spontaneous, bloodthirsty attacks were a co-ordinated response to continued trespasses into Tarrery territory. \nIt is said the Bloodclaws feasted on the spleen of the grey flatfish, and so doing, entered a trance-like state of pure violence. As such, many of the Bloodclaws returned from massacres not knowing what it was they had done. Those that did know, would have the memory purged in a ritual involving whale oil candles. The heads and bodies of these killers was marked with the black-red claw as a sign of having done their duty, and they would never be asked to eat the flatfish again.
codex.0bef1ee6075a98b54579e721ed558e51=39. Warlocks of the Zephyr\r\nClouds are important, and few could claim to be as wise to their threats, as cognisant of their blessings as the Warlocks of the Zephyr. The Zephyrs carried jars of clouds they had trapped, which they stirred with their untrimmed nails.\r\nIt is said that some had success controlling the seasons, and were able to summon snow, rain or wind at will. I would have refuted this in the strongest terms, back when life was \"normal\", but these days I'm not so sure.\r\nSuffice to say, the Zephyr's instincts were truer than any Gallish mathematical calculation, and this made them useful in battle, although they preferred not to fight at all if they could help it. The account of the battle over Ternanu in 3033 records that the Zephyr's ship Cumulonimble disappeared through a thunderous cloud wall, never to be seen again.
codex.2ed35c2ae805cd74700966ea0d7daba2=40. The House of Pyrites\r\nThe Pyrites were the traditional adversary of the House of Ice, but things were usually a lot more civil between them than depicted in the Book of Ice. That is, until about 2994, when the Pyrites came to represent those who believed the House of Ice had grown too powerful. They were effectively the sole government of Verduba. These new Pyrites believed the House of Ice were brainwashing young people, and thus preventing alternative ideas from flourishing. \r\nAction had to be taken. In the small city of Saskadunc, West Verduba, the Pyrites amassed, their flame-wreathed swords burning through the night as they marched on Muskdog in protest. What followed was the most violent episode in Verduban history. \r\nWho'd have thought, that a society once so tolerant, would be undone by a clash of ideologies.
codex.729d6f3482329c7def866f886984d13c=41.The survivors at Capulca, founders of a new world. \nI didn't think I deserved to live. But writing this has made me think again. We are the founders of something new, the last hope for humankind to atone. With such loss, so many unfulfilled dreams, I can't help but think the universe reserves a special disregard for the feelings of humans. That only makes me more determined to fight, to re-establish us. \n\nMay our heroes rest in peace, their work is done.
codex.0c7e64896ad754fc37c97c67bf2a79c8=The four footmen, each to shoulder a pole of my gilded palanquin, are totally without reproof. Were they instead the types to overhear and sell scandal for profit, my position or my life might soon be in danger. \r\nI chose them carefully - a quartet of former Bandini slaves. The instant they were parted from the Saborians, I told them they were free. When they then seemed lost, I explained I still desired their services, but would pay them in gold. What human can work without incentive?    \r\n\r\nI am certain that these four will serve me to the bitterest end. I believe they will say nothing of the confidential matters that pass the curtain door, even if they are privy to some alarming truths.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly midnight, and I am beginning to fall asleep among the emerald upholsteries when a cowled figure approaches my carriage. My servants are sat down about the place, a good deal more at home than is usual. This is their time of respite, when they crowd the air with genteel puffs of smoke, and place bets over dice. Thus I draw back the wainscot door myself. A cool breeze suffuses the cabin. I watch as the figure taps the fine gauze through which we would momentarily be speaking.
codex.e6fdacd5407dd072377cc24e89cb5a0c=A small and frail hand reaches through the opening and releases a disc of currency into my hand. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, Forgiveness, I am pleased to find you,\" says a slight voice from under the cowl, and I know at once its poorly-disguised owner. I extinguish my lantern and commence my routine.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, nameless one, under the sight of our holy Empress. I shall let no word slip, for I am Warlock of Forgiveness, empowered to listen, if little else, to your crimes and tribulations, in the hope that you may heal.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot heal. I cannot,\" says the meekness beneath the cowl. \r\n\r\n\"If you speak it, then you may heal. I promise,\" I say flatly. I can muster no zeal, so frequent is his patronage. He is a figure not just well-known to me, but to all others. Ah, but already I have said too much.   \r\n\r\n\"I cannot bear this burden alone. I have lived a sorry life, and must confide in you. No other can keep my secret.\"
codex.dc45c64d2bab3bc135d78d7a20261594=Until now, I have said not a whit of these audiences. The gauze traps the words between my patron and I. The obligations of ordainment are not to be taken lightly, coloured by the tradition of a thousand Warlocks of Forgiveness before me. When the hottest day comes, I ride to the southernmost bay of Ishgiru, and lie on a rock where my body is scalded. Only by suffering can the evils I have soaked up be purged. \r\n\r\nBut now, when the light of the world is blinking, the ground shakes, and the footmen who carry my palanquin stagger, that I defect. I become an informant. Dear reader, you must know at whose door lies the blame.\r\n\r\n\"You pushed her in?\" I say with mock surprise, for I have heard it all before.\r\n\r\n\"It was not a push, but the gentlest touch, at which she flinched. She never let me touch her. Oh the way she fell, her eyes bulged in mid-air, and I saw awfulness there. Then she was down over the bank. When I looked, I saw her body bob quickly away on the white water.\"
codex.2c86828657b26d1fbca193c050816e9e=There is a sudden chorus of noise to our left. It is the Empress' school and the ringing of the twelve o'clock bell, just before the midnight feast. The doors open and the boarding children cheer for a great Ptarmigan, who dances breathlessly between them, trying to avoid being caught. I spared a thought for the poor operator inside the bird.\r\n\r\n\"It is a terrible thing to have done, by accident or otherwise. I know how it haunts you. I shall say nothing of it. Do you see her fear in the eyes of others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes I do. And I abuse it, I abuse it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you abuse it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It began when I betrayed my sister. Other terrible things. Lately, the fifty dead at court.\"\r\n\r\n\"..anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"My subjugation of Tangana. She must know, but she does not resist.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you still have a chance to make things right?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Forgiveness. Soon it all ends.\"
codex.f62a2aa31271cae6da7b8432875b0322=The stranger refers to our last discussion. His is a soulful urge we Warlocks have. A divine voice impelling us to take action, good or bad.\r\n\r\n\"You still feel guilt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must do what I do, it is the path of the Karem. Our forefathers would agree. But I am finding it hard. To destroy everything goes against logic. Though what goes against logic is often truth.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded as if in agreement, though truly I was bemused. The maniac voice meandered on.\r\n\r\n\"The path is dark ahead. None can hold a candle to this blackness in me. I must come to you for the comfort of last light, of the gloaming, and if you deny it, then I ask for pity.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must all make sacrifices. I shall say nothing of this,\" I said. At last he was finished. He bowed and paced away. I closed the curtain door, and sentenced myself to a nap. 
codex.883d130f33bc0698b137e419ffb7a0c3=I am rudely awoken by a rat-tatting. Two visitations in one evening. I wonder if it is the position of the two moons.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness, what is it?\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, the Nabob Vulio.\"\r\n\r\nI sit bolt upright, discomposing the stack of cushions about me. I get my eye up close to the gauze. He is unrecognisably gaunt, unwell even. He coughs and splutters, and his catchpenny jerkin has ridden up revealing pleats of skin at his sides, where the fat used to be. \r\n\r\n\"Vulio? What the bloody hell happened to you?\" I say, but then I realise he must be here for professional support. \r\n\r\n\"I have come for forgiveness, Forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nHe roots about in his satchel and pulls out his purse, pennies spilling out onto the cobblestone. He plants the whole thing in my votive cup with a crash. \r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, nameless one, under the sight of our holy Empress. I shall let no word slip, for I am Warlock of Forgiveness, empowered to listen, if little else, to your crimes and tribulations, in the hope that you may heal.\"
codex.1a4ecce931507b968bfb79a596d4621f=Vulio sniffs and casts down his eyes, they cling in their sockets like rancid mussels. \r\n\r\n\"There's someone else. She told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I told her I'd give her everything to stay. She said there was nothing I could give that was better than his love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you have him killed? Hire a snake?\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't sound very forgiving,\" he said, tapping at the gauze to get at me.\r\n\r\n\"Fair enough,\" I said, and backed away.\r\n\r\n\"In any case, she doesn't love me. Doesn't it just show, money can't get you everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"At least it can get you the consolations of the age - banquets, theatre, concubines. Take your mind off things?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no! You're supposed to be helpful. Can't you see I wish to be forgiven for my greed!? I wish to repent all the vileness of my life, and learn to live as she would have it, 'simply but happily'.\"\r\n\r\nI sighed.
codex.a9aa8a94555cf7f058910b88b011edba=I saw that poor sod Vulio off. He seemed happier. I wish I could tell him and everyone else what Gloam said. Puts things into perspective, you know, when the world is likely to end.\r\n\r\nI'll never forgive myself. Unburdening the sick of mind, letting them believe their atrocities are forgivable, all for a bit of coin. I'll never shine a lantern through the veil of my own failings, never bleach them out. I've let everyone off the hook, but I won't let myself off it, not this time. \r\n\r\nI called to the palanquin boys. In spite of the hour they rose without fuss. \r\n\r\n\"Lads,\" I said, removing my great fur hat for the last time, \"I want you to kill me. Make it quick and sudden. You can keep anything I own.\"\r\n\r\nThey hold up a candle to the gauze curtain, flames lick it and burn the little square away. I look at the sombre faces. As I say, these Bandini are totally without reproof. They do as told, they do not complain, they do not ask questions.\r\n\r\n\"But give me a single day, just one day, then we shall be in the month of Skrambau, the month of death. Then do not hesitate. Once I am good and dead, be sure to celebrate well. Tragedy is just around the corner.\" They nodded. \r\n\r\nGood lads, they'll get it done. Then I hope they return to Bandinia, since the Saborians are gone. I don't know how much time they have left, but I hope they enjoy it.
codex.00671b8744773681887165a536bd9a8f=Great long tresses of red hair, plucked from the heads of Tarrery lasses, drape from the balcony to form a curtain. The hairs part for the Nabob Vulio, whose cabble of fat-rolls jubble under his wafery tabard. But Nabob Vulio has bearing, he commands respect, and is nobody's fool - at least not here at court. His girth is a sign of success, and he has no shortage of attendants to mop his brow with cold towels. \r\n\r\nIt is a hot day, and sweat is a-gush over all. The landing doors are thrown open, and a pleasing draft flutters the papers of the court floor. The court has an imposing green boxed wooden roof from which bright green and gold mobiles dangle. The beams must have been in place for more than two-thousand years, yet the entire building has since floated upward, and now rocks against its mooring high above Ten-Rui. In its centre is the dais of ordainment, the holy seat of the principals of the Kioki Unity. \r\n\r\nTo the left, is the lowest of three thrones - that of the Empress. As a child, the Empress demanded that the chair be made a swing. A green baize lines the swing to comfort her behind. Its steel cables are oiled daily, with whale oil from the Tarrery sea, for the Empress cannot abide any squeaking.
codex.8fc62bfba9802d2a20c98091c374194c=The Empress is of childbearing age, but she does not look it. She has a sprightly face and a fine mind, though her knowledge of the world does not extend far beyond this room, for this is where she spends most of her days. She barely has any knowledge of her own city, since while not forcibly confined, her duties are too common and time-consuming to allow her to wander. This room is her nursery, her sanctuary. She playfully teases the stiff courtiers by pulling their noses, then she returns to her seat, and begins to swing.\r\n\r\nTo the centre of the dais, slightly raised above the Empress' chair, sits the Warlock of the Gloam. The bird's nest he wears for a hat, is twice the size of his head, and comes down over his eyes. His true name is not known. He will, time-to-time, play his pipe, and all know that somewhere, someone has passed on. The Warlock has many interests, some of which are understood. Most of all, he is wont to ask questions of his friends the mice. The little whiskers roam the court, eating leftovers from the banquet. They keep the place clean and tidy.
codex.94ac01dd19e018931c2ef2b594f65028=The Empress has forgiven Gloam. She needs him. What if there is another attack, another Dragon-dog? \r\n\r\nIt is said the mice are Gloam's spies, his advisers. On every ship, they eavesdrop. Greyfin is the largest of them, and their master. One of his legs is deformed like a fish's fin. It is Greyfin who gathers their whispers, and from the Warlock's shoulder, pours them into his ear. Gloam keeps no coin purse, for he does not like it to dirty his fingers. He has a manservant who follows him, and unclasps the purse when the need arises.\r\n\r\nNo-one sits in the third chair. For this chair belongs to the Elder of the Pin. If the Elder of the Pin ever came to court, neither of his cheeks could settle on something so small. Besides the chair is too high for most to reach, and sits on display above the green silk of the dais, just as the three nations rise to the great Pintin mountains in the north.
codex.6cc3097b961170cfaccfa70e349a0494=The Empress speaks;\r\n\r\n\"I have very sensitive skin, and yet I feel nothing of these tremors. Why are these workers so afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that they are afraid of falling, Empress,\" says a courtier. He wears an improbably tall and thin hat, of crushed green velvet. He is the Empress' thirteenth cousin, on her father's side. \r\n\r\n\"Well then, does it not please them to use the stones?\"  \r\n\r\n\"Many of the stones they might have used, have fallen into the mire,\" says Nabob Vulio.\r\n\r\n\"What a shame - a great waste. They must indeed be careless - let us then, allow nature to determine their fate - and let us recover as much of the remaining Atlas as we may.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree, Empress,\" says the Warlock of the Gloam.
codex.6a5e7d28dba430b322aacd04a5637cdc=After the court adjourns, the Warlock strides through the hair curtain, and a smattering of the mice follow his lead. The antechamber corridor is wooden floored, polished. At the end of the corridor is the veranda, behind a set of tall glass doors. He walks towards it, and the busy merchants nod out of politeness. The Warlock is feared, not loved. Ahead of him, the mice gather at the heels of another man dressed in skins. The man begins to jump in pain, as the mice bite his ankles. \n\n\"Are we not meeting, Edvers?\" says the Warlock of the Gloam.\n\n\"Get off! Get off! Ueghegh!\" cries the man, and in his panic, drops the cane at his side and worse, the telescopic lens from his eye. It falls and smashes on the floor. \n\n\"Oh Dear Edvers!\" says the Warlock of the Gloam, sardonically. The children's teeth on a string around his neck rattle. \n\n\"I am not so named any more, Gloam! I must remind you once again that I am Warlock of the Moss!\"\n\n\"Ah yes. Moss,\" says the Gloam, with a titter, \"a great honour to meet you again.\"\n\n\"If people know my true name to be Edvers, they may hold heuristic power over me. You of all know that it is an ill omen, Gloam.\"\n\n\"Ill indeed. Come, let us sit with the others.\"
codex.9a0952a20196a1f9602a19c3cbd5a74f=Outside, all around, the birds hum upon the flowers of the water garden. They seem quiet and saddened. \r\n\r\nGloam and Moss walk into the chalk circle. Warlocks of Karem will only meet in a circle of chalk, for nothing else will do. You see, inside the chalk barrier, their souls remain closed. \r\n\r\nA young boy pours chalk over the feet of Gloam and Moss, and Moss smiles into the beaming sun. \r\n\"Nice to be outside, eh Edvers?\" says Gloam, but Moss does not reply.\r\n\"Edvers?!\" says the Warlock of the Summer Meadow, belching and bellowing with laughter, carafe of rosehip wine in his hand. \r\n\r\nThe Warlock of the Firmament lies prone and rigid, like a dead man, inside the circle. His lips unclasp;\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak his birthname. It is an hermetical solecism,\" he says patiently, his eyes still closed.\r\n\r\n\"That is what I told him Firmament!\" says Moss, \"I have not now been Edvers for many years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pah,\" says Gloam, and places his music pipe against his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Damn you Gloam, do not play that thing while in the circle of chalk. It is not permitted,\" says Firmament.\r\n\r\n\"Then how will my mice know to join us?\" \r\n\r\n\"You must step outside the circle, and then play!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is no longer impromptu, and the mood falters.\"\r\n\r\nThusly discussion continues, until the Warlocks have had their meeting. It is no surprise that the merchants have little time for them.
codex.1f096fb2cd7aaa0774751067c6b42509=But lo! A Nabob approaches Gloam, and they move into the shade. \r\n\r\n\"May we speak privately sir?\" says the Nabob, with evident bewilderment at the practices of the chalk circles.\r\n\r\n\"I believe we are out of earshot,\" says Gloam.\r\n\r\n\"It is about the Atlas sir,\" says Mannigo quietly, for that is his name.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. You have them then? Pin must be bled - it does good to bleed now and then. The gloam augurs it. Five nights in succession now, a bird has died, just at the precise moment that darkness has fallen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Far be it from me to say,\" says Nabob Mannigo, \"but does not darkness fall gradual?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool! There is always a precise moment at which the coin disappears into the purse. What of the stones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes we have them, yet I fear the Pin are unhappy with the arrangement. They have heard stories of the earth tremors at Ten-Rui. They do not wish to volunteer the stones any longer. I fear the Elder of Pin may finally come to court, and take his place in the third chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"The third throne is no larger than one of the Empress' shoes. Should the Elder of Pin be small enough to sit on it, the Empress shall stamp said tiny person beneath her heel,\" says Gloam, waving the Nabob away.
codex.553cdc654358216daa0f0f91228241ff=A time has passed since the low-town fell, and since the day the Dragon-Dog led an assault on the court in the name of a lie. The blood of the fifty has been cleaned from the walls, and the Dragon-Dog captured and tossed into the hole where the low-town was. But trouble brews in the north, and the Empress must see to it.\r\n\r\nThe canard sail, and the raft-pull are cut free, and her lady's ship billows up like knickers on a line. The Empress' bust adorns the wooden bowsprit, leading the fleet by this token. It is ceremony from bygone days, when the wind was obliged to carry ships across the seas.\r\n\r\n\"It will be best if you remain below deck. Let me see to the humdrum things,\" says Gloam. \r\n\r\n\"Good. I find the air too bright,\" croaks the young Empress, for she has been sick of late, and lies in the sorry gloom of her navel chamber, plunking away at her Pati-Pikk. They say the recent collapse has touched her in some deep sense.\r\n\r\n\"Should I seek the Warlock of Forgiveness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seek him not,\" says Gloam, changing the subject, \"I have situated the contraption. I hope you are well enough at least to spectate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Empress looks at the sorry sight before her. On the campaign table, marked with the flags of the Saborian cities, Gloam has placed an unctuous and pongy cheese. Over it is a cruel-looking mousetrap. He slips a mouse from his pocket, and lets it run onto the table. It smells the air.
codex.e121d33823be85761160b8d9c5243a07=\"And what of the outcome, what will it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, even I do not know Empress. Perhaps the dreams of your next sleep can tell you. If the mouse survives its peril and takes the cheese, you may lie upon the bed differently than if it is killed.\"\r\n\r\nThe mouse seems to realise something is amiss. It stands on two feet, and regards Gloam uncertainly. \r\n\r\n\"Will the mouse not curse you Gloam, if it allies you and this mechanical danger?\"   \r\n\r\n\"Well it might at first, but then it shall puzzle. Is the danger not of its own making? The cheese is a great prize, but a mouse can survive without it - a mouse can live an ascetic life, taking pleasure in berries and seeds that occur naturally, it does not have to gorge itself on cheese.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if there are any berries or seeds aboard, Gloam.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's beside the point, Empress. This is theory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, it seems there are many possibilities Warlock. I am alert, and happily await the spectacle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Empress, I shall leave you to enjoy,\" says the Warlock of the Gloam, his jagged stride engulfing the mizzen stair and bounding him out onto the deck among the company of skylers.\r\n\r\n\"How far to the smelly lands?\" he asks one.\r\n\r\n\"Not far now sir, perhaps a half-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Leave the other ships in the rear, so as not to fright the poor creatures. To see a third fleet upon the horizon would be to throw a sparrow among the beetles.\" \r\n\r\n\"I shall pass on the message, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, the Warlock climbed onwards to the rudder. He always wants to steer.
codex.1bbe2bb4b465cb1aca11be3940696eab=At first it is awkward around the table. Mr Roussi's moustaches twitch, and his arms are folded across his chest.\r\n\r\nThe Empress however, seems optimistic. She extends her long-sleeved arm toward Roussi, and offers him a dainty Ishgiruan sweet from the golden dish. The pastry pyramid does not waver, but Roussi, as he looks over it, licks his lips. Still, he will not buckle, and firmly shakes his head.\r\n\r\nThe Empress inclines her dark and smiling face, and swings the dish to the other side of the table, where Miss Tannequin is stood with her back to them, looking out through the glass at the morning cloud.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Tannenquin?\" asks the Empress, and her guest twizzles around. For the first time, Roussi can admire her fully.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I think I will. Thank you,\" she says, reaching for a pastry.\r\n\r\nAs Tannenquin draws close to the table, an insipid puff of her perfume makes the Empress cough. But Mr. Roussi's nostrils ripple, and he appears to swoon.  \r\nMiss Tannenquin takes a bite of one, it crumbles awkwardly, flaking over her dress.\r\n\r\n\"Oh whoopsy,\" Tannenquin says, brushing herself, \"very tasty indeed, are you sure you will not have one Roussi?\"\r\n\r\nRoussi mutters under his breath. Sensing progress, the Empress swings the golden dish back to Roussi. This time he can barely hold back the drool, for all Chabuti love a good pastry.
codex.b84ecb38226086ecfdf9d2fb9d79ad63=\"If I must,\" he says, taking one and crunching it into his mouth. Some of the flakes stick in his bristles. \r\n\r\n\"I'll take another one,\" he says helpfully, \"save you the trouble of passing me the plate again.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opens, and Gloam prances in, Greyfin upon his shoulder. He closes the door on the cold, and removing his mantle gown, tosses it upon the empty chair at the head of the table.    \r\n\r\n\"Empress, we cannot suffer these idiots any longer.\"\r\n\r\nThe two delegates are mortified.\r\n\r\n\"Warlock, what can you mean?\" says the Empress with mock uncertainty, since she is wise enough to see his plan.\r\n\r\n\"If the two sides cannot receive our wisdom, why should we remain here, when this quarrel is not ours?\"\r\n\r\nThe Empress brushes her black-ribboned hair, she knows this game.\r\n\r\n\"But Warlock, these two are not enemies. Look at the mildness of their faces. Though apparently they intend to fight to the death, they seem more like husband and wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what sense good lady?\" says Mr. Roussi, who is so entranced by Tannenquin, that he unwittingly stands and hits his head upon a wax lamp.\r\n\r\n\"In the sense that your nations, Melliflua and Chabuti, have been close for many years. While at first you were content, you find yourselves wearying of marriage, and willing to separate over any trifling old matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Korchis mountains, trifling?!\" Roussi's face reddens. But Tannenquin is intrigued.\r\n\r\n\"Korchis is important, but I do see what you mean,\" says Tannenquin, rubbing her uppity nose.
codex.de123fcbf731427d7463d01be8c1c206=The Warlock of the Gloam smiles, and takes a pastry from the dish. He feeds it to Greyfin, who sits at his shoulder. Whether it is this that tips the balance of Mr. Roussi's mind is not clear. He stands and begins to bellow. \r\n\r\n\"For three weeks, Mellifluan ships have trespassed along our border, shooting down our vessels, and yet here you are playing down the situation!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mellifluans have done you wrong, and must repent for their actions. Still, a little bickering is to be expected in a long and lasting relationship,\" says the Empress.\r\n\r\nTannequin raises her hand as if to speak, but shortly withdraws it. The Empress stands up. Her emerald dress spangled with gems, and burst with slashes of pure white fabric beneath. \r\n\r\n\"The Kioki can be your marriage counsel. We can defend you from one another,\" she announces, \"for a small fee, we can intercede and help you to settle peacefully. War is the last thing you desire, for I see in your eyes that a fondness lingers,\" she smirks.
codex.f2d6a6a9f0f758f9f7b1486b9bfb12aa=Mr. Roussi drools over Miss Tannenquin just as he did over the pastry dish.   \r\n\r\n\"Good,\" says Gloam, \"it is decided then. The fee shall be a percentage of your Atlas forthwith, and..\" he says, turning to Tannequin, \"a discontinuance of your fraternity with the Saborians.\"\r\n\r\nBut Tannenquin met Roussi's gaze and returned it, at least in equal part. The Empress and her counsel, the Gloam, had become mere bystanders.\r\n\r\n\"Roussi, can we really find it within ourselves to love one another?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that I'm certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us agree to wed, and the Warlock and his Mistress be witness.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? I am no-one's mistress!\" says the Empress crossly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, why not,\" says Gloam. He is eager not to break the spell.\r\n\r\nOnce their guests have left, and a most peculiar peace treaty been drawn up, the Empress feels more like her old self again, and even takes to the open deck for a promenade with her loyal Warlock.

Oh yes, that was a horrid thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mouse obtained the cheese without injury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Marvellous,\" says Gloam, \"clever little thing. How did your dreams subsequently fare?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had no dreams at all, it was horrid, and a disappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me Empress, of the three troubles that weighed upon you before we set sail from Ten-Rui, which has not now been resolved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they are all resolved! The dust that rose up from the low-town is abated. I was ill, now I am cured. Atlas was dwindling, now we will have more.\"\r\n\r\n\"What therefore, was catalyst for this new good fortune?\"\r\n\r\n\"The little mouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. Squeaky unburdened you.

It will not require our ministrations to come about - far too late for that. In fact, we can do nothing to stop it.\"\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, Firmament stands up, his skyward vigil broken. This appears to be a matter of genuine importance. \r\n\r\n\"I was talking about the war with Sabor, of what horror do you speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, the war. The war will continue until the end. Sabor would not cease, even if we did.\"\r\n\r\n\"What end is this? The end of Foundation?\" shrieks Firmament. His black cloak is caked in chalk from the circle, and he smells of urine. Gloam takes a step back.\r\n\r\n\"It is plain that we have been headed that way. Regard your precious firmament - the heavens. The air is choked with Atlas, the unsettled dust of the dead. The sickly green skins of the miners haunt my sleep. Your sun, your stars, the air above us - it is meaningless, empty. Our sovereign dwells neither up there, nor here in court, but far below...its poison swells in our veins, and now, when we are weakened, it skirts about us, and begins to squeeze.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this devious creature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Greed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours is a most disturbing turn, Gloam. Speaking plainly, it is you who encourages this war. You whip the horse, though its eyes are already crazed. If the war could be ended, then perhaps things could go back to the way they were. The way they have always been.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no going back!\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear I must oppose it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" says Gloam. He lifts a hand and touches Firmament, drawing the sign of affliction upon his cheek. Firmament steps away. He is marked, and knows he has not long left to live.
codex.99438a1f382271b32488a14b9e4f6eb1=It is night, and the Warlock of the Gloam steps inside court to see the Empress. She is gravely ill, and will only hear counsel from him. So he tells her that she must ready herself for a final battle, in which all humankind shall have a stake. \r\n\r\n\"Victory or defeat are not important, but your very participation will redeem you.\" \r\n\r\nShe nods weakly in agreement from her pillow, for a guilt as heavy as Ten-Rui's low-town anchors her there. She will figurehead the flagship, plunging into the space between the two lines. It will be the last time.
codex.b988bea096da33c2804ade3b446b9552=I have done well in my work and deserve a rest. I have my garden to attend to, and dinners down in old Darnik, where the wash floods the salt fields. Yet in these troubled times it still soothes me to approach a matter which, while on the outside appears straightforward, provides a surprise turn under examination. \r\n\r\nBut this shall be my last case, I think. I am too tired, too tired.\r\nWho more fitting to bring it to me then, than Empress Tangana of the Kioki, who some call \"the sickly\". Sick or well, she is still as pretty as a Verduban rose.\r\n\r\nRumour of my success in some small matters has evidently spread as high as her court, and I was told by telegram to expect a visit. In my reply, I explained that justice was the right of all people, whether they be born lowest, or indeed highest in the land.
codex.24dd162c4d34eb077a8b8ea879a5b91d=I was summoned to port at Darnik by Sorvik's pipe - what a wonderful long-legged beast it is, dispatching messages to all parts of the marsh. \r\n\r\nAs I walked leisurely between the bobbing platforms of the marsh, I saw that a vast and ornate skyship had docked in the estuary, and knew it must belong to the Empress. When I drew near, a party disembarked to meet me. \r\n\r\nIt rankles they found my appearance so astonishing, since I took the utmost care in my wardrobe that day. Nevertheless they quickly set aside their prejudice, and asked what payment I might expect in return for helping the Empress with a mystery. \r\n\r\nI had considered the matter in advance, and answered directly, \"If I settle your case, I would like Great Marsha to have the protection of the Unity if it comes to war with the Saborians.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, the party of scribe and counsel turned away sharply, and went back aboard the ship.
codex.fe0e4b15e3920db67a5c647299604ad3=To my amazement, the Empress then appeared in person. I could scarcely believe I merited her personal attendance. She did, however, seem angry.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" she asked the courtiers, \"will he not simply take gold?\r\n\r\nThe courtiers were finding it difficult to keep up. \r\n\r\n\"Where is the impudent man?\"\r\n\r\nBut when I was pointed out, the Empress grinned a great big grin.\r\n\r\n\"But this fellow? Oh he is adorable!\"\r\n\r\nShe inspected me as if I were an ancient artefact.\r\n\r\n\"Are you very old?\" she said.\r\n\r\nI lifted my stick, and danced a small dance on the gleaming deck. \r\n\r\n\"Not in body!\" I said, in my best Ishgiruan.\r\n\r\nShe laughed, putting her delicate dark fingers to her lips. \r\n\r\n\"And what lovely skin. So pale, it's almost green,\" she said, then seemed for a moment saddened. She looked upon the quiet little harbour of Darnik, which to her must have seemed so quaint, and seemed to relax. \r\n\r\n\"Come, let us discuss the case in my quarters.\" \r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" I said.

My life was court, stuck between three tiny rooms...\"\r\n\r\nI knew the rooms to be in actual fact grandly-sized, but thought better of correcting her.\r\n\r\n\"...when I did have a rare moment alone, I'd gaze up at the skyships and dream of being an explorer, navigating the jungles of Koinos, or finding sunken treasure in the warm sea.

In return, I swear you shall have protection if Sabor ever threatens your people.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, I shall be delighted to take your case,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThe Empress sighed, and I immediately regretted my poor choice of words.\r\n\r\n\"My dear mother. I was only ever told she'd died, not how or why. But recent developments have me asking questions.\" \r\n\r\n\"Recent developments?\" I said. \r\n\r\n\"Come, let us sail for Ten-Rui. It will take a week, and I am keen to return. Perhaps seeing things for yourself will aid your deduction.\"\r\n\r\nI felt a pang that I must once again leave my beloved Marsha, but nothing could dissuade me from the promise of a new case.
codex.4edc270548a154513f04e7e055c5eb5f=And so it was that I packed a bag, and took a cabin of my own aboard the Empress' private vessel. The food wasn't to my taste - no fresh fish! But the Ishgiruan \"Gubba\" band were a real pleasure to hear, very vigourous indeed. \r\nBut I digress. On the second evening, the case came to life, when I heard the story of Empress Massimala's death retold by her longest-serving aide. \r\n\r\n\"One morning Empress Massimala slept in. My girls knew her bad temper, and decided she should be allowed to rest. When we returned in the early afternoon, they found her dead. She was only young, fancy dying of natural causes at the age of forty-six!\" \r\n\r\nAccording to the aide, the court doctor blamed her thinness, which had complicated the delivery of baby Tangana. But she insisted that was six years earlier, and couldn't have had anything to do with the death. \r\nOther facts they saw as incidental were curious to me, for example, that the Empress had changed from her nightgown into just underwear by the time they found her in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nI inquired as to the doctor who filed the mortician's report.\r\n\r\n\"The Warlock of Koinos,\" she said, \"He used to be court doctor, but retired to his home in Qahvzin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must go to Qahvzin!\" I cried.
codex.74d07717f531ec2408f68f8f6da472e2=We flew over the fields and forest of Karem, before landing the skyship, and riding the final mile in the Empress' palanquin. She had arranged me a place at her side during the journey, during which she managed her politics by use of a conical apparatus. \r\n\r\nAs we drew up to the estate, the Warlock of Koinos was in the process of clipping back his flowers. He was very old, his hair thin and scarce.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, Koinos,\" said the Empress.\r\n\r\nKoinos' hooded eyes peered at us for a few moments, then returned to his task.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness,\" he muttered, \"what on earth could possibly bring you, and this frog-fellow, all the way out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"The death of my mother,\" said Empress Tangana.\r\n\r\n\"Thought so. Why don't you just let the thing lie, like everyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not address the Empress in that tone,\" said one of the clerks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh shut your cake-hole! I do as I please. If you've come here to chop off my head, get on with it.\"\r\n\r\nHe snipped a great cushion of foliage onto his lap. The Empress made a huff of displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"I will not chop it off, Koinos, until you have relinquished the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told the truth. Your mother died naturally.\"\r\n\r\nI hopped down off the palanquin without the aid of its bearers, and approached him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not fear death?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume by your title, that you are a master of medicine, as is common to the people of Koinos? And that you are the medic who bore the crane badge at court during the time of Massimala's passing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I am, Frog-man. Of what importance is it to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely question whether by lying about the nature of Empress Massimala's death, you betray your entire legacy as a sworn medic of the cranes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What slander! My lawyer shall hear of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady Mr. Puggibun,\" called the Empress from her cushion, \"the people of Karem do not take accusation lightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I do not make it lightly.

He scratched his head, ruffling up his wispy hair.\r\n\r\n\"I told them I was concerned. Those strange white bumps on her skin, and all the fuss with her young age. The woman was in perfect health. I didn't like her, but she was in perfect health.\"\r\n\r\nI looked back up to the palanquin, but the Empress was unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"Only lately, have I thought what may have happened that day. May have happened. It was a long time ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was your involvement in the matter?\" I said, shaking the end of my cane crossly at him. I found it most aggravating that he had clung to these secrets so long, and betrayed his country.\r\n\r\n\"I received a letter. It told me to keep peculiarities of the examination under my hat, in return for a substantial payment.

But if one were to fall into a patch, one would likely fall asleep and never wake up.\" \r\n\r\nThe Empress looked dismayed. We were getting deep now. I offered her a strand of marshweed, which she put daintily into her mouth.\r\n\"Furthermore, an incident took place in the Karem town of Putty involving this very plant. It was many years ago now. The case concerned a warlock who wanted rid of a rival, and tried to thread nettles into the lining of his robe. His rival caught him in the act, and the warlock was imprisoned for an attempted murder. Certain details match exactly with the account of your mother's death.\"

Now..let me see to my business, your highness.\"\n\n\"Wait. Do you remember I spoke of a development that made up my mind to call on your services?\"\n\nShe thrust a letter into my hands. It read as follows;\n\nDear Empress,\nI killed your mother. It was me.

codex.a67aef3155e05c35de48e2d3432c865d=I was so thrown by the letter, that I put aside the investigation I had planned in the imperial bedroom, and immediately began an analysis of the letter's contents. \r\n\r\nThe hand had been careful to write in such a way as to appear naive, and probably in no way resembled the owner's true style. The paper used was ordinary for the region, and of course, I was drawn immediately to the mysterious \"S\", which was either an audacious clue, or a red herring. \r\n\r\n\"Horrible isn't it,\" said the Empress, \"and with everything else, I feel like I don't want to go on living any more.\"\r\n\r\nI knew not what she meant by \"everything else,\" but I did what I could to steer away from darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Come now, take heart.

But I did stumble across the piece I was looking for, an ancient tome called \"The Book of Soil\", still widely read at court. I remembered the stories from when I was a child, and something about them seemed to connect to the case.\r\n\r\nOf course, when I then read them, it seemed obvious - the poor discontented at the rich, the rise of a \"cult of the true Empress\" in the east. Of the true Empress' guardians; the crane, the dragon-dog, the mouse and the snake, it was the story of the snake I was most interested in.\r\n \r\nI took the earliest opportunity to put my theory to the Empress.  \r\n\r\n\"If the snake from your sacred book lived now, who might he or she be?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Snake? I can think of only one. The spymaster, the Warlock of the Snake.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is under your command?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strictly. But we must be careful, his ears are the walls. His warlockery has great reach, far beyond this city. Your probing troubles me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he is the main suspect in this case, Empress. I do not know how much time we have, for a spymaster will already be aware of my presence and no doubt plots against us.\"
codex.5a7147384fdebb4ec588de8830dfcf27=Making our escape from the Empress' chambers disguised in the  simpler dress of courtiers, we bustled quickly across the complex. I followed the Empress into a grand outhouse, and down some marble steps. She pointed to a concealed door between a stack of wine barrels.  \r\n\r\n\"What do we expect to find beyond it?\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"A tailor, probably from an impoverished background, working carefully over one of your dresses,\" I said.\r\n\r\nWe opened the door, and there he was, exactly as I had described. \r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" he said agitatedly.\r\n\r\n\"I am your Empress,\" she said, and the tailor cowered.\r\n\r\n\"I beg forgiveness, highness.\" \r\n\r\n\"Explain yourself to Mr. Puggibun, and it might be considered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" I said, \"the Empress' dress you are working on.

codex.6fa4a6777cefa5924be8d0e9e83b30a7=I heard the Warlock of the Snake was smiling as guards marched him from his hideaway at Wellah. They said there were no jeers from the people that lined the street, since the cult of the true Empress has strong support there. \r\n\r\nAs for his punishment, the law is strict in Ishgiru, especially for treason. I did not wait to see the Empress hang him. I am tired, so very tired, you see.\r\n\r\nI considered my service to the Empress complete, and she, however grateful, needed to return to the serious business of running the Unity.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for all your efforts, Mr Puggibun. You may consider your half of our agreement honoured, although I hope I can count on the support of the Marsha fleet, if the time comes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know if we have a \"fleet\" as such,\" I said, \"but I'll ask around.\"\r\n\r\nShe even stooped to give me a brief squeeze, which was a great comfort to an old man. As the tethers fell away from the ship, I pondered her gentle face, and wondered how it was that she and her court could have overlooked the plight of the poor in the low-town.

Then he closed the privy door, and I heard his footsteps beat away. \r\n\r\nThis was a happening I hadn't anticipated. All the confidence I had in the closure of the case was now unfastened, and I began to wonder who, if not the Warlock of the Snake, was truly behind these machinations.

A letter signed \"S\" containing a reference to a \"bite\" in the night.\" I'd sewn the case up so fast, it didn't occur to me how, more than anything else, the intention of the letter seemed to be to strike fear into Empress Tangana.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt in my mind that it was Snake who killed Empress Massimala, and that he'd heard of my investigation and withdrawn to Wellah. But writing that letter? Why? It gave him to us on a platter. \r\n\r\nNo, someone else wanted him to be caught. Even the tailor was exactly where we expected him to be. But with the Snake at Wellah, there was nothing to prevent him being paid to wait there by someone else, and why did he give up the location of his master so easily?    \r\n\r\nI made sure to take foreign newspapers at breakfast for the following weeks, and my suspicions were confirmed by a headline in the Ishgiru Hawker; \"Warlock of the Snake denied involvement in plot to kill Empress Tangana, but admitted killing Massimala.\"  \r\n\r\nI had no intention of returning to Ishgiru, for fear of causing more harm than good, and I prayed that the Empress was able to hold out against this other force.

The reporter was Alys Tropsy.\n\nThe Pauper is Saved!\n\nThe other day I saw an astounding thing. It was hot, and I was walking past the fountain of Tropos, where the line of the equator divides the city. I had a magnificent view of the Court of the Empress. Suddenly it began to judder! Beneath it there was a glow and a crackle, and before I knew it the thing had detached and was ballooning upward! Of course you will have heard already, but it was the symbolism of that moment that got me thinking... is this the dawn of something new and great?\n\nWe await the crowning of our Empress-in-waiting Melina, now less than two months away. Most of us will only live to see a coronation once, perhaps twice, so this is a special time. The Warlock of the Hem will commission her garment, which shall serve throughout her office, and the Warlock of the Gloam shall present her with the lock of her mother's hair for remembrance and continuity.\n\nOf course, while we shouldn't speak ill of the dead, her mother was a terrible snob. \"Like mother, like daughter,\" so they say - but our ears in the court tell us otherwise. They say Melina (like the fairy tale) cares for us paupers and will bring us together, rich and poor. An Empress cannot embrace a withered beggar, or personally find parents for orphans, but she can lift us up with the stones.\n\nAlready we are seeing Ten-Rui change for the better. Skyships are not the key to the city, but a key to the world! Already great liners flood harbours and sky-harbours from far and wide. Atlas is everywhere, and with it we can all be explorers, discovering distant lands, returning with the treasures of the wilds. Our ships are our swords, and the skies are the enemy through whom we thrust. The pauper and the Empress may yet live side-by-side!

Non-Saborians shall not have this support, they are mortal, and we can offer them nothing but our pity.\n4. The tenets of Apotheosis are now engraved in Redusa square for all to see. \n5. A fifth tenet has been imagined for greater enjoyment of our godliness. The age at which we rise, should now be middle age. A true god needs no more time than that to succeed.\n6. We are gods. Every task shall be shared for equal duration. Aptitude must make way for adaptitude, for the benefit of society. \n7. Let the academies be levitated, so that the children can see the world below.\n8. Atlas shall be circulated as and when required by the Utopian and The Committee. The Utopian shall decide how this marvel will perfect our perfection. \n\nOther matters; \n\nCommittee motion passed: A skyway shall be erected over the coming five years. The skyway shall allow all Saborians to travel between Momoros and Redusa, and will circuit both cities. The skyway will be operated free of charge. Passengers will need to display a citizen's ticket, and accompanying Book of Entitlement to use the service.\n\nCommittee motion passed: The godhand livery shall now be silver, the colours of old Redusa, so that they are easy to discern from others.

codex.c400f922b85721ab038adb80b89b8fe8=From a diary in 2804.\n\nSeveral unremarkable days passed travelling over the ocean, before we came across something special. Koinos - the lost place, it is just as they say. It is all jungle, and is rather hair-raising (read further and you shall discover!). How different, yet similar, is the city of Ten-Rui to this thriving darkness. Both are chaos, but that is the rich soup from which variety is born. \n\nAnd some of the first people are still here! The Pekoe faces seem timeless, unwrinkled. They worry overly about coming to harm - it's funny to live like that here, where peril waits at every fork. \nTerrifyingly, I myself blundered into a situation. We were walking beside a lagoon, when before I knew it, a great snakehead was hanging off my arm, fangs deep. I could feel a stretcher beneath me, it was made of the skin of the snake. A terrible pain set in, my vision melted, and I could see the Pekoe busying about. They applied a salve to the arm wound, and pressed bitter, numbing leaves into my mouth.\n\nWhen I awoke, a beautiful girl stood before me. She seemed unable to smile - you know, there is no business here more serious than life itself.\n\"You were one of the lucky ones,\" she said. \nThese Pekoe make Ten-Rui touts seem positively jolly! The girl was typical of her people. Every scratch and itch causes them distress, yet they permit spiny plants and savage beasts to freely proliferate at the ends of their beds. It is said they place the animal kingdom high above our own, since animals do not have the trouble of thinking. Guide says \"the power of thought was bestowed upon humans as a curse, in return for the power of the stones\", by which he means Atlas.\n\nFunny that, because when they do use Atlas, it's not for skyships. They don't seem to use it for anything but medicine. While these \"healing\" techniques haven't hindered my recovery, I'm not sure I understand how placing stones beneath my pillow can help.

codex.e6378c79fbc45018e951b82d99831402=Verduban theological tract - from the year 2998. \n\nAnd so in the Mellifluan canon, the god Shabo used her gigantic claws to lift a rock from beneath the warm sea, and roll it atop the centipede-god Agonon. Agonon had been her lover, but had an affair with Baliandri, multi-gendered god of dualities. This, therefore, was Shabo's revenge.\nAgonon was completely covered by the boulder (which was believed to have formed Melliflua), and unable to move. Agonon was the most cunning of all the gods, and having spent a thousand years motionless in thought, a plan came to him. \n\nAgonon summoned tree trunks unto each of his hundred hands, and having done so, beat a rhythm upon the underside of the boulder. After a further thousand years, the drumming had reached such resonance that the rock shook. A crack appeared, and Agonon squeezed his body out. But Shabo was still angry, and had been lying in wait. She had an even larger boulder ready, which she dropped immediately on his head. It is said this second boulder formed the lands where the Chabuti now live. The Mellifluans and Chabuti still refer to their continent as \"Shabo\" in her honour.
codex.985571179ede6988bd4e7a58f3c9ccdf=Verduban theological tract - continued...\n\nAgonon tried in vain to summon the trees to his hands again, but he was too weak from his drumming. Still he tried to wriggle free, and they say his efforts caused the Korchis mountains to form. Whenever a temblor is felt in Melliflua, it is supposedly his tail twitching, as he dies his eternal death. His death is creation, preservation and destruction embodied. When he finally dies, it is believed, the world will enter a state of dark limbo. \n\nThis story tells us a little about the primitive Mellifluans, and how they used their fantastical gods to explain natural phenomena such as earthquakes. The question remains, however, of why these earthquakes seem now to be growing stronger each year. Needless to say, the one true god will show us in due course. Don't waste your strength cracking the icy lake, when spring, given time, will melt it.

But everything I do is catastrophic. \n\nIt's the first time we've had Shabo's Honour off the ground for two years. It's a tired and filthy boat, but they say we've one last hurrah to give. \n\nEvery time I go on stage I am made to feel worthless. The crowd's patience is short, and as the curtain drops, they reach for their pockets as if to reward us. Instead, they dig out nanban peels, and heaven-knows-what-else, and fling them at the stage. I can see they enjoy this more than our performances. \n\nBut yesterday, I did something terrible. I was leaning over the side, all the while thanking providence I was high above, and that as yet, I had no reason to take up some unseemly low-town enterprise. So I wished that should I ever lose my beautiful looks, or my talent, that the darkness should take me. Then one-by-one I dropped the petals of the flower overboard to seal my wish.\n\nI heard a popping and screech, and clouds of rubble shook the ship and blotted the sun. I staggered below deck, coughing into my 'kerchief. I joined the other faces at the observation glass. The upper city gleamed blithely in the evening light, while giants fought with fire below it. It was vile, oh truly it was!\n\nIf I never look in a mirror again, I shall not see myself, but the monster who consumed the low-town. I ran away to cry.

Apart from losing the rich heritage of these areas, we worry about other effects that may be induced. It doesn't matter whose fault it is.

We have already had a sinkhole incident at the university, when we thought ourselves immune.\n\nThis ongoing and seemingly interminable conflict does not seem to be helping in the least. Can we find a delicate mode of intervention, slowing down the war effort on both sides, and reducing the casualties?

Chef Molin always serves hot, with a scatter of fresh seasonal herbs to cut through the richness.     \n\n\"Wine Snecket.\"\nA portfolio of fresh creamy cheeses verging on over-ripeness, as is the custom of this region, are \"jacketed\" or \"suited\" in a small amount of the wine sauce. Wine Snecket needs to be sharp and strong with wine, and as such, it is not a dish for wee tots. The dish is normally served with sweet fresh berries and a crisp-grain tuile.\n\n\"Grapes with white custard.\" \nThis time it is not just sweetness, but the comforting blanket of white custard that neutralises the gooey grapes that are in turns dried and dunked in water until they resemble gigantic sultanas. The dish is traditionally served with a tall cylindrical sponge to give it height.
codex.a94109fd32232b7895ccd191dfa34fb1=\"Fishy gusset balls, with saline reduction.\"\nAlthough it sounds unappetising, this dish is actually one of the highlights of the region. It involves the careful preparation of fish belly (usually the Common Lipknaw), rolled in a peppery breadcrumb crust. The saline reduction serves only to extend the saltiness to an unprecedented level, but can be countered with the addition of Miri-biri seakelp, which burst with a sweet acidic freshness on the palate.\n\n\"Berserk pig, dressed in Tree-nut sauce.\"       \nThe berserk pig is an ingredient that must be handled carefully. A common mistake is to pacify the pig, and kill it quietly. The best chefs know that, unlike with most butchery, the meat of this pig is best when the animal dies in a berserk state. The animal will only become stressed if it does not reach a berserk state before death. \nA common method is the blood feast, used by the Chabuti (it is a little gory, and the Mellifluans have banned it) whereby the pig is starved, then released into an arena with mice, that it chases and devours. At the peak of its lust for mouse-blood, the pig is stuck through the skull with a spear point, its face a picture of ecstasy.\nPreparation aside, the dish is simple, hearty fare. A Tree-nut sauce usually accompanies the roasted meat, and is made of crushed Tree-nuts, shells and silks removed, a whippy wine-cream, and fresh herbs.\n\n\"Wild horse olio, with snudge, bellet and mossycress.\"\nA peasant dish from the hills north of Melliflua, now eaten the world over. Chef Molin has taken it to another level with the addition of three key components. Snudge we all know, but not when paired with the slow-cooked horse. Bellet dumplets add texture, and mossycress a freshness that completes the dish without detracting from the powerful meatiness of the olio.
codex.79d2036bf4e092131b70d5274295c414=Part Two - Delving into the cuisine of the ancient Pekoe.\n\nThis region's cuisine has many wonderful health benefits, and some even taste ok!\nI have never found time to visit Pekoe, and nor should you need to, because the very best they have to offer is right here on my menu! Please note; the Pekoe do not seem to eat puddings.  \n\n\"Baked Flies with Fireroot jellies, wild gritgrains and samphor.\" \nWoody and Nutritious, this dish hasn't evolved in centuries. I have therefore changed little but the preparation of the flies, which can either be cured or smoked. Samphor is a stringy bark that must be cooked until tender. The Fireroot jellies are a ferocious accompaniment that must be served in small cubes.   \n\n\"Knacker.\"\nA simple dish, comprised of a single sea-goat testicle. It is steamed for a long time in an earth oven, served with a jus made with the cooking liquid and a secret blend of sharp berries. Not a personal favourite, but distinctive certainly, and authentic.\n\n\"Pekoe Pekoe (with kibbles).\"\nThe national dish, and justifiably so. Yellow ratfish hot smoked in greyroot. Kibbles add some fibre and balance. A sweet almost medicinal sauce of yakka leaf is ladled over. This dish is the toughest test for a young Pekoe wife, because cooking the dish is part of a prenuptial agreement. Should the male be unhappy, it is common for the woman to remain unmarried for the rest of her life. Author's note: The prenuptial dish is traditionally served to both the bride and groom's family. As such, fights often break out when some underlying reason for the couple not to wed prevails over the quality of the cookery. In one case, for example, the father of the groom declared the bride-to-be's dish unpalatable, allegedly because she had rejected his own advances. Perhaps rightly, the father was dismembered once the young lady's testimony was verified.
codex.07b9e462db5a1becb70c6935642850a7=Part Three - Of oft-forgotten Tarrery.\n\nIn this book, I follow Pekoe with Tarrery intentionally. Tarrery is mistakenly derided by inferior chefs such as the overrated Antchovie Popomp Glace for being heavy and unhealthy. In my view, its nuances remain criminally underexplored. What Popomp Glace - who is an ignoramus - misses, is that Tarrery food must has always been this way. \nIf like the Tarrery man, you must travel many miles home to your wife in a freezing hailstorm, bundle of slain animals in tow, wearing nothing but a strung vest and a sheathbugler over your pimpled legs... would you expect a plate of stingy stringy green tidbits as reward? Tarrery men are made of strong stuff. These meals are for cold days, and are nearly always served with Ogball - a whitish tuber.\n\n\"Bleb.\"\nA very rare ingredient is Bleb. These tiny carnivorous sea flowers are found beneath the ice sheet, and feed on passing plankton. When they themselves are eaten, they have a sugary sweet nectar and crisp flowers that need little cooking, but careful handling and preparation. \n\n\"Iced Seal Cream.\"\nWe all know that seal milk is as thick as mayonnaise. When frozen, and infused with a complementary flavour it produces a rich and unctuous dessert that all may enjoy. Youngsters may be the first to clamour for this treat, as it is an experience much akin to their pre-weaning years.
codex.a2760bab65dadae32e03bb456e091ef8=\"Seal and Whale on a plate.\"    \nNot as simple as it sounds. A Tarrery wife may toil for two days in the butchery of both Seal and Whale meat which is then slow-cooked. A stock is fashioned from their entrails, which serves as a thick bisque. Young salt crooks are collected from the tundra, and carefully rinsed and pickled in brine so that they remain fresh and green. Boiled Ogballs bring weight and further soft comfort to the dish. As long as your ingredients are fresh, you will have no complaints from your diners, especially if the weather is bitter, and the night is long and dark.\n\n\"Crab Pie.\"\nThis pie simply must be made with blubber pastry. No part of the whale goes unused by the Tarrery, and blubber is held in the greatest regard. Melting blubber down to an oil is common practice. This oil has many non-culinary uses, but here it is combined with the pastry to produce a delightful salty crust. The crab filling must include both white and brown flesh, and sprigs of curly wellow leaf to top it. Comes with Ogballs.
codex.a8fbf50ad2553de4fd13951c4dadc9ca=Part Four - Savouring Sabor.\n\nIf a culinary utopia exists, it is in our own cuisine: the everyday food of us Saborians. We balance savoury and sweet, hot and cool, crispy and soft better than any other. We do not over-experiment like the Gall (thankfully not featured in this volume) - and the simplicity of our cooking is an art. Many Saborian chefs have little experience and time to train, and expert instructions exist for nearly all of our favourite dishes, so that they can be easily followed. The ingredients available to us are unsurpassed, and as such, we have little reason to import anything. \n\nBy noting examples here, I feel that we shall not be forgotten. We are gods.\n\n\"Low-tide Rainbow Fish, Nanban, Grasses and Fireseed.\"\nThe fish is pan-fried, and its skin crisped separately in the oven. Nanbans are served three ways. Fireseed and Grass season the dish.\nThe dish borrows something from the tropical island of Nicobocar in the warm sea. A dish fit for a god.\n\n\"Golden Crescent.\"\nSweet incense-smoked fig in crisp layered pastry complements woody and sour goat cheese from the Mount of Plenty. Usually served with volcanic ash crumb and a scattering of sultana and nanban. It is of course, the dish usually selected by those headed to the rising place to die, as a final farewell treat. 
codex.0742b30d83ff0790a1c006fa533b67fb=\"Nectar and sweet honey cream.\"\nSaborians are very fond of beekeeping, and admire the selfless and communal nature of these ephemeral creatures. Honey is mixed into cow cream, and used as an accompaniment to the nectar of the sacred apogee flower. The apogee flower has white berries and grows only at a grove north of Momoros. It's flavour is uniquely floral but refreshing. The combination is quite sweet, but with a good glug of dry wine, it goes down splendidly.\n\n\"Apotheon Cake.\"\nIt is a cake that dwarfs all others. It is the celebration of a time in our lives when we can afford to indulge a little. Our athletes achieve the unthinkable by scaling Apotheon, and what better way to celebrate it than by making a really fabulous cake! \nThe cake is made of whipped cream, and is usually five tiers high, one for each of the tenets leading to apotheosis. Each layer has a different fruit sorbet, each representing one of the committee colours, e.g. Nanban puree for yellow, Hingberry for red. Finally, the cake is topped with the traditional sugar-paper Apotheon.
codex.68696bfa928e99fc2d76d38921ee47e7=Part Five - Karnivorous Karem and Pescatarian Pin.\n\nThe Karem are meat-eaters. They cannot understand vegetarianism, that is unless, a warlock has recommended it, as they sometimes do. By contrast the Pin tend to eat only fish and beans, and instead of butchery, they keep livestock for butters and cheeses. The exception to this is the long neck, of which no part of a mature animal is wasted.\n\nThe friend of visitors to Karem looking to sample the best food, would have to be the Warlock of the Fields or of the Harvest, who you will find at the chalk circles outside Putty. The Warlock of the Fields always wears a string of Karem's best-known truffles, which are usually available from the month of Qang onwards. \n\n\"Bison meat, Truffle vestiges. Marrow of the flying tree monkey. Bitter herb syrup.\"   \nThis relatively balanced dish still gives the guts a vigorous workout, and sticky dried fruit or some such for pudding might be wise. Nevertheless this dish has a meaty earthiness that resonates with the beautiful autumn forests of Karem, and that the bison is brought to earth by a brave hunter, should be enough to convince even the most ardent grass-eater over to the dark side. Or not.\n\n\"Lamed horse, corral of ogball, greens, beans and hide gravy.\" \nA rustler's dream, and one frequently seen on the menu in rural Karem. Usually cooked up in one big pot, this dish has fed the northern swath of Kioki for generations.\n\n\"Carpaccio of long-neck, with a roast nut and hillside salsa.\"\nIf Karem tastes prove a little unrefined for you, this dish proves how versatile the culinary imagination of the region is. The meat is usually air-dried after a good deal of beating.
codex.278d1531699b84cedda7cb968e886276=\"Dried Fish in long-neck butter, with long-neck cheese, and orange and yellow vegetables.\"\nStrange the Pin enjoy fish so much, when only one or two coastal towns have access to fresh catch. Before Atlas, the wealthy folk of Huacanado, high up in the Pintins, would revel in the rarity and delicacy of dried fish, not realising how good the fresh stuff was. With skyships, it became possible for Huacanado to receive some fish, though due to the long distance from coast to capital, the dried stuff still remains central to the Pinnish diet. \n\n\"Pinnish Goatbear festival pudding.\"\r\nThis is a curious thing, in the main because the Goatbear of Pin is an elusive creature, while its festival pudding could be said to be the least elusive of all puddings. Those that consume it, in fact, achieve a remarkable degree of conspicuousness. \r\nIt is usually a tiered series of liquor-drenched sponges, through the centre of which is held a royal fruit jelly of seasonal mountain fruits. The whole thing is doused in lashings of creamy splurge. \r\nIf it sounds like I regret eating twice my weight of it, I assure you I don't regret a thing.\r\n\r\n\"Karemel.\"\r\nA sweet apple puree, beneath a layer of crackable caramel ice. Little rocks of iced llama cream adorn the finished dish. In essence, very simple, but tricky to execute without Chef Molin at your shoulder.
codex.c71acac8fd77c763767e40262a7adeb8=Part Six - Ten-piece Ten-Rui, and Ish Salad culture.\n\nContrast is a big part of composing the perfect dish. But no greater contrast exists in one place than in the Imperial heart of Ishgiru, and the vast city of Ten-Rui. It is a chaotic place, where people of every type and creed gather, and from this disorder comes a similar lack of refinement and consistency in the culinary sphere. \nThe endless banquet you'd expect when dining with the Empress and her courtiers, bears no relation to the food the folk of the low-town eat, which has much more in common with central and east Ishgiruan staples such as flatbread. \nRather than eating at sensible pre-arranged times, Ishgiruans eat as and when they can, and particularly disgustingly, whilst going about other business. In my view, food cannot be allowed to become a background, it must always be given the chance to come to the fore. Still there are times when eating Ishgiruan cuisine that I've thought they might be onto something.
codex.b1c4c5f054e6712a47627326fd618a48=\"Imperial bird-board.\"\r\nCourtly Food is very rich indeed, and lacks the nutrients and fibres that constitute a healthy diet. Nevertheless, the first year I worked the frillship circuit and found myself invited to dine with a Nabob of the Poultry guild, I was assured that dinner would be spectacular in every sense. Sure enough a wooden board appeared before me, a ten-piece entr\\u00e9e of stuffed birds. Hawk, owl, heron, duck, chicken, goose, sparrow, turkey, swan, and lastly the centrepiece, the fried breast of a miniature eagle. Birds are iconic to the Ishgiruans, yet this dish shows the contradiction at the heart of Ishgiruan life. The best thing about it was an intense truffle cream dashed between the game. I remember I skipped the rest of the meal, and had thoughts of veganism.\r\n\r\n\"Bean flatbread with a sizzle.\" \r\nOut in the rural country, which is greener, but less fertile than Sabor, you'll find yourself in the little fort towns from the old days when the so-called True Empress reigned. Bean pastes and hot sauce fill flatbreads which are made in clay ovens. Sometimes grains and green leaves are served on top. A healthy dish that feeds the poorest Ishgiruans, but one I would be happy to serve in my restaurant. \r\n\r\n\"East coast salad.\"\r\nThe east coast is a place of music and home to people who just want to enjoy life. They grow salad leaves and vegetables in little glass houses, and sometimes serve them with white fish. Simple but tasty fare.\r\nMy take on the east coast salad uses tomato, ogball, egg cream, mixed leaves, fresh spirrel leaves and a crack of pepper.
codex.222b398d728f8e3bdc4986c0d2f64dc5=\"Nabob's Delight.\"\nIf you've ever heard stories about the Tower of Nabobs, an unholy place, you'll probably be familiar with this Ten-Rui classic. Nabob's Delight is sweet cream made with cream, sugar, one owl egg, and the pod of a Humbuck bean. They are mixed and heated gently, all the while whipped to a froth. The resulting sauce can be poured on anything, and if Nabobs are involved, I mean anything.\n\n\"Stilt-Festival Cheese Board\"\nRather irritatingly, everything in Ten-Rui seems to come on boards and slates instead of plates. This dish associated with the cheesemonger's guild brings a different cheese from each of the ten large dairies of the west counties. As a homage to the region, this is an apt mishmash. The whole thing comes with salad, but I place it in the dessert section since sweet pickles and fruit chutneys come with it, and it is served after savouries (as is normal in Ishgiru).
codex.20db2ceffee754aeb48fcc893b0f0189=Part Seven - The Fire and Ice of Verduba.\n\nThe cooking of Verduba is defined by the harmonies of hot and cold. What better way to enjoy the bitter cold shore of Gautine, than to spice your dishes with the wealth of unusual ingredients that grow in the south Verduban hinterlands. A small apron of temperate soil drapes beneath the volcanoes and the southern highlands, where it is shielded from the icy wind, and it is here that unusual culinary species are cultivated. They range from piquant anise to bright floral rose peppercorn, and permeate almost every dish of the Verduban repertoire.\n\nAsh berry soup with chicken and beer.\r\nThis is a very distinctive and warming soup. The base is made with finely diced onion and beer. Once this has simmered suitably, a very thick chicken jelly stock is added, and once separated, a handful of whole ash berries are added. Once the dish has bubbled away slightly, the whole thing is sieved finely, and is served with crusty malted bread. \r\n\r\nNuggin-cheese tart, with lardons and winter greens.\r\nNuggin is a flowering plant, whose seeds need a very hot summer to grow. Fortunately, the glasshouses of the aforementioned apron of temperate land in south Verduba provides just this. When added to dishes, these little seeds lend an earthy nutty flavour to mild tastes such as cheeses. Though they love stews and soups, the Verdubans also like bitter green vegetables that grow so hardily in the grip of winter.\r\n\r\nSeared Peppered Ox, with babyhead beans and charcoal.\r\nThis Ox steak is cooked the traditional way - over an open fire. It always comes with babyhead beans, shaped exactly as they sound, and a dabbing line of breadcrumbs and charcoal. The presentation of this one is - like the Verdubans - a bit too precious for my liking, but it does taste good. 
codex.40ff28a7cee34a0b75b1a54209cd7f8a=Ash and Mutberry crumble, with Finnigok leaves.\nEven sweet dishes such as this delicious crumble do not leave the kitchen without a bit of magic. First, the very unusual inclusion of pine charcoal, which tamps down the sharpness of the Mutberry, and then from another angle on the palate comes the perfume of Finnigok leaf. \nI tried several of these in Verduba, and found the southerly version the better, because the Mutberries were naturally sweeter there, and less sugar was needed to find a balance. \nIf you want to make this yourself, it is possible to obtain Mutberries at Agbanese stores.  \n\nButter-Bread\nNot so much of a pudding as a way of life, butter bread is light and buttery, and to be found everywhere in Verduba. It is taken at breakfast time with a dose of vittles, or picked up on the way to work. Butter bread has regional variations - the bread is always shaped like a part of the body, ears etc. It's all quite good fun, and tells you a lot about Verdubans. The strange thing is, the different shapes do seem to make each bread taste unique. 
codex.f5b20753fa946b54152a8ad0686295ad=Feather's Revenge\n\nLike father, like son. \nIt is fortunate then, that I am his daughter, and no great expectation falls upon me to follow in my father's line of work.\n\nBut if people call you \"the most beautiful girl in Ishgiru\", and your father is the Nabob Rhegus Dawn, owner of the duchy of Murgatary, where we have unending fields of sheep, cows and whatever else - though I never saw so much as a lamb's hair of any of it - and as a child, when one's toys are covered in gemstones and pearls from the Studded Desert, and as one grows up one feels a growing dis-ease at the dishonourable nature of one's parents, and the lies they bury, you may find yourself dreaming of a life more meaningful. A life of beery, manly, oily work.\n\nMy name is Rosetta Dawn. Like all relations of the Empress, I schooled at the Crested Ptarmigan in Ten-Rui. When I was fourteen, it was agreed by my father that I would marry the Nabob Vulio. I firmly believed my kind father could only ever act in my best interests, and when I was sixteen, I met my husband-to-be for the first time. Our wedding was to be held the following year, a month before my seventeenth birthday, and I was eager to catch a glimpse. By the Empress' hairpins, was I disappointed. \n\n\"I lost count of his stocks in silver,\" Father oozed, as he aired his cloak over the marble balcony.\n\n\"I lost count of his chins,\" I said, \"and what does he actually do? I've never seen him do anything.\"
codex.bd184fbd318347c340293d7197d5e338=I went to mother, but mother wouldn't listen. She was bitter about her own marriage.\n\n\"Your father is always right.\"\n\nIf I must suffer, so must you, it sounded like.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I demand to holiday. Savoie, fetch me my parasol and some changes of clothes.\"\n\nAnd so Savoie, the best of our young ladies, followed me around with my great wardrobe. What a burden it must have been for her! \n\nI spoke to the estate-keeper, and asked him to find a pilot who could take me somewhere quiet and peaceful, away from the city. Sure enough such a pilot arrived. A Pin with whiskers called De Noc\\u00e9. From the moment we set off he was pouring himself glasses of shnockel, and generally making trouble. Worst of all was his pursuit of my ladies, like a cat among pigeons. \n\n\"Get out and stay out!\" I heard Savoie shout, and drew back the linen of my cabin to the sight of her battering De Noc\\u00e9 over the head with a parasol.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" I called.\n\n\"Oh terribly sorry lady Rosetta,\" replied Savoie, \"but he has been making a nuisance of himself.\"\n\n\"Behave!\" I said, but De Noc\\u00e9 simply giggled. \n\nDe Noc\\u00e9's shnockel spilled over the deck as he swayed from side-to-side, he said we were headed for my uncle's estate in Oppeetobee.
codex.0551fb811d651c0686e8bcc1f5058e44=Oppeetobee had been home to some of the greatest debates, and the chalk circles drew a mighty crowd.\r\n\r\nI was determined to find in that crowd, the most disreputable and scruffy man I could, and if not to kiss him, then to pretend to do so, and let my father catch wind of the gossip. But I was so captivated by the roar of the crowd and the bickering of the warlocks, I entirely forgot my quest. \r\n\r\nWhen the debate was over, I went for a walk. The city was old, with some of the rickety charm the Karemese loved. They were a sly people, who looked at one another conspiratorially when I walked by. Before long, our little group had wandered out of town and into the hills. I skipped ahead excitedly. \r\n  \r\n\"Please wait dear lady Rosetta,\" Savoie cried, but I ran faster and faster until their voices were far behind. Orange and yellow trees seem to grow up around me. I discovered I was frightfully lost.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I heard a gazumphing. Wondering what it was, I followed the sound. It brought me to a large clearing, at the centre of which stood a tall young man with the dark complexion and blonde hair so particular to the Karem. His hair was silky-smooth, and tied back in a bundle behind his head. His mouth was sharp and broad. He was handsome, though I remember I thought him too thin.
codex.21f3868f09112f1b1074c913aee1e575=\"Ho there! Excuse me,\" I said, flapping the insects from my skirt. \r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he jumped. Then cautiously, he extended his hand to help me escape a sticky-leaf plant that was threatening to further embarrass me. \r\n\r\n\"Horris Feather,\" he said, \"I was just testing the orchard for sap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sap?\" I said.\r\n\r\nI realised the instrument by his feet must have been the source of the gazumphing noise I had heard.\r\n\r\n\"Oh the tree resin. It's very important for lightweight designs.\"\r\n\r\nI must have looked confused.\r\n\r\n\"For my engines,\" he said, then after a pause, \"Are you lost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well now,\" I said, doing an idiotic little cough.\r\n\r\n\"Well I can lead you back, no trouble,\" he offered, \"I was just on my way back down.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're very kind,\" I said, \"but I shall be quite alright, thank you.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled politely and walked on, all the while berating myself for spurning his help.
codex.4cc4821ff8695d8102f03c8dae336922=It took the mountain search party led by the great yellow sniffer dogs they call \"lappers\" to find me, bereft of hope, sat on a tuffet at the foot of a small ravine. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lady Dawn,\" cried Savoie, as the dogs piggled my face, and the light of several torches lit the rock face. \r\n\r\n\"Take me home,\" I said wearily.\r\n\r\nBut the next day I had a slight fever, and was advised to stay abed. During the afternoon, I had an unexpected visitor. I heard a commotion from beyond the door, then it burst open, and the young man of the previous evening appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Feather!\" I said, pulling the silk sheet up over me. I immediately noticed his distemper, and wondered if he was angry that I'd denied his offer of help on the hillside. But that wasn't it.\r\n\r\n\"I merely wished to tell you, madam, that I know who you are. Therefore, it seems pitifully obvious to me that your 'chance' appearance in these parts is actually a plot to deprive me of my secrets! Shame on you, shame on your father! Has he not done enough harm already!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice rose with passion at the end, then he stepped out and slammed the door behind him.
codex.ff2eed19e28840bc28f58acd2a135ab4=Now, the next day we were resolved to leave, the holiday having come to a sour end. Savoie bustled about, gathering things up, and gushing about the Nabob Vulio's personal qualities, which so irritated me that I locked her in the cleaning cupboard and instructed no-one to let her out until I was gone from the estate.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of pride, I had decided I must distance myself from my father in the eyes of the young Mr Feather. I'd had nothing to do with Dawnfire, or any of my father's industries, and in fairness to father, he'd never suggested I should.\r\n\r\n\"Business is for menfolk,\" he once said.\r\n\r\n\"What of the Empress?\"  \r\n\r\n\"Pah,\" he'd chuckled, \"a figurehead, nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nI sought advice from my pilot, De Noc\\u00e9, on the whereabouts of Mr Feather's factory.\r\n\r\n\"Can only be Eagle-eye,\" he slurred, \"at the water's edge.\"\r\n\r\nSo I ventured out into a heavy rainstorm, and lightning streaked the sky. I rushed through an avenue of folk so unsavoury I was almost persuaded to turn back, when I spotted the sign \"Eagle-eye\". The building from which it limply dangled was nothing like my father's premises, but instead half-collapsed, with scorched brickery and no roof. \r\n\r\nThere was a dreadful burnt smell, mingled with effluent. I held my nose and creaked open the large square sheet of metal that seemed to constitute a door.
codex.dee4fa5e2426126c81abd23c77765ddb=A few heads looked up, but none seemed willing to pay me due notice.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me sir,\" I said to a grizzled face, as he ploughed back and forth on some sort of pulley-cycle. \r\n\r\n\"Whatsit?\" he spat, still not looking up to my face.\r\n\r\nI tried to affect my Karemese to sound like him. \"Would you be so kind as to let me know the whereabouts of Mr Horris Feather. The man suddenly shot to attention, his neck stuck rigid.     \r\n\r\n\"Mr Feather's up on the crow, like as always.\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured at a helical staircase which led up to a windowed room. There was a face through the glass, he was looking straight at me. I straightened my skirt and marched up the steps to the office. It looked down over the workshop, the cramped half of which was operating busily, the other half deserted, where it fell beneath the missing roof. \r\n\r\n\"I can explain,\" I said, on opening the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Feather sat down on his stool. There were only embers left of his earlier rage.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to know that I'm not working for my father. I'll never work for him. That is all,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you,\" he said. He couldn't have been more than nineteen or twenty.\r\n\"You've smelled the soot?\" \r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did notice-\"\r\n\r\n\"-three months ago, your father had my workshop burned down.\"
codex.6ae93e3948893babb54340ba3cfdbbb1=So there it was; proof father was despicable. Horris explained how he had won a contract for the war, and that father had reacted badly.\r\n\r\nHorris told me how the blaze had begun at night, and that among the gutted remains they'd found a bottle of spirit, which must have been lit and tossed through an open window. \r\n\r\nAn old fellow with frizzy white hair and a Karemese flat cap appeared at the top of the crow steps.\r\n  \r\n\"This is my right-hand, Steed,\" said Feather.\r\n\r\n\"Consorting with the enemy?\" choked Steed as he loosened his greasy cravat. Feather smiled. \r\n\r\n\"Steed, let's give Miss Dawn a tour of the factory.\"\r\n\r\nHe had decided that my understanding of his business was feeble enough that I could not possibly be a spy. And so it was that I saw all the grubbins and bobbins being made, and the oily-handed men and women of the foothills making-do in the cinderous squalor. Throughout the tour, Mr Feather gave his advice where it was needed, and said nothing when it wasn't. I was most impressed by his serious attitude in all things, and his passion for his craft.\r\n\r\nIt struck me then that this was the kind of eager young man I craved to meet at the Warlock circles. How better to spoil my marriage than to flirt with one of my father's rivals!\r\n\r\nI told Mr Feather that I would remain in Oppeetobee to assist him in the reconstruction of his factory in whatever capacity I could. 
codex.70604704cbca90d1c4d73b5643da5e09=I lodged at my uncle's estate and remained committed to my plan, despite Savoie's protestations. I asked De Noc\\u00e9 to take her and the others back to Ten-Rui, to which he agreed. De Noc\\u00e9 seemed to have my best interests at heart. After all it was him who had arranged for us to visit Oppeetobee in the first place, and now thanks to him I had the freedom of it.\n\nI used the small monthly stipend from father to enlist the help of a group of nomadic Bandinians who had escaped the troubles. I paid them to assist with the repair of the Eagle-eye factory perimeter, which they did, and Horris was ever so grateful.   \n\nHorris was terribly chivalrous, and despite his obsession with work, I began to suspect he held unspoken feelings toward me.\n\nIt was about a month later when I received the following letter from my father, delivered by hand from his courier;\n\nRosetta,\n\nI extracted from De Noc\\u00e9 the news that you have prolonged your holiday. May I remind you that the marriage preparations must begin before the month of Kif, or it will be too late. \n\nRumour has it you are squatting with beggars, I hope this isn't true.\n\nI have dispatched a new pilot to collect you, and withhold your stipend pending your return.\n\nYour Father, \nThe Grand Nabob Rhegus Dawn.\nChair of Dawnfire Systems
codex.373b8e9dc9d41902182b26d95076be99=I sent him a reply as follows;\n\nFather,\n\nI am not \"squatting\" as you term it, but rather hoping to save the business of Mr Horris Feather, with whom I know you are not personally acquainted, but are acutely aware of.\n\nIn fact, it has come to my attention that you are the source of his present misery.\n\nAs it happens, I am very fond of Mr. Feather, and have no intention of marrying the Nabob Vulio, who is revolting.\n\nRosetta\nAshamed to be your kin\n\nP.S. Hang your stipend! I shall work for my living like everyone else!\n\nThe events of the next few months were so horrific, it is only because of my present circumstances that I am able to relate it with a sense of perspective.\n\nFirst there was a terrible earthquake, like the ones in the low-town. It was a setback to the restoration project, since several new cracks opened up, but luckily no-one was hurt. We decided it was easier to knock part of the factory down and start again. I was making good a wall with a trowel and cement, when through an unfilled crevice in the brickery I was sure I could see a figure laying low in the long grass. \n\n\"Who is that?\" I called out, at which the figure picked up and ran into the hedgerow.\n\nI told old Steed what I had seen.\n\n\"Are you absolutely sure?\" he said.\n\n\"You patronising old pomp,\" I said, \"of course I'm sure!\"\n\nThis put him deep in thought for a moment. \n\n\"Do you know anyone who would want Mr. Feather dead?\" he said.\n\n\"I do,\" I replied, \"And I also know who he'd ask to do it.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Why his best friend is the Warlock of the Snake, the spymaster.\"
codex.328ef513f363f29b2b3693724e92e0ff=In the sap glade, crouched Steed and I. The rain poured, the trap was set. \r\n\r\nAn assassin worth their salt would have followed Horris up the hill to the glade, where they'd know they could find him alone. \r\n\r\nHorris had a sword just in case, but the capture would be down to Steed and I, so I'd hired a trio of strongarms from the town hostelry in case there was any trouble.\r\n\r\nSure enough we heard the snapping of small twigs. Steed looked over the fallen log. \r\n\r\n\"He's got a bow!\" Steed shouted, and he and the strongarms set off towards the assassin, who was dressed in camouflage green. He loosed an arrow and it struck Steed in the arm and felled him. But the strongarms got hold of the would-be assassin and pounded him until he was soft.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark business. Horris asked the strongarms if they knew anyone that would be able to 'deal' with the man we had taken prisoner, and they had said they did not. It was a question for a while as to what we would do with him, but I asked the assassin, once he was recovered enough to speak, exactly how much he had been paid. I doubled his fee using the last of my stipend, and asked him to guard my Horris against any further encounter.
codex.feaf51d6bcc20cfe618f0c653cad90a8=Horris asked me to marry him and I said yes!\r\nWe would be wed as soon as he had finished the consignment for the war effort he said.\r\n\r\nOf course, I knew the consignment would never be finished. With the earth shifting every day, the walls had come down again, and I had no money left to put them back up. Rain from the incessant storms was ruining production, and even the most loyal of Horris' workers was thinking of giving up. \r\n\r\nBut Horris wouldn't listen, he ploughed on day and night, and I worried for his health. Then one evening he cracked. \r\n\r\n\"The bolts have sheared, they must have gotten wet,\" said Steed.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no, no!\" said Horris, throwing the broken gasket to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Let it go, Horris,\" I said, \"you have to let it go.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's right Mr. Feather,\" said Steed, \"but we've one last project.\"
codex.784b4feafa9d7ae0b5e8e0085d3646ea=It took every ounce of his knowledge and skill, the retooling of many components, but when Mr. Feather stepped back to take in his new creation, I could see he was satisfied. \n\n\"She'll be a good ship. I dub her Rosetta.\"\n\n\"A very good ship. The best you've ever made. But quickly, the storm worsens,\" said Steed, \n\nAs the skyship took up into the purple thunder, I looked back at Oppeetobee. It slanted, like sand in an hourglass. It had all happened so quickly. How things of beauty die or are broken, and we are left wondering what it's all for. \nI still had my Horris, and how I longed, even if it was our last act, to become Mrs. Rosetta Feather. \n\nBut first we stopped at Ten-Rui, at the house.\n\n\"Father, you must come with us. Savoie and the maids will all be there. De Noc\\u00e9 will pilot her. Rosetta is built especially for these terrors, the best ship ever built.\"\n\n\"Ha! More hyperbole from that squitty pimpled rat. Best ship ever? I've been doing this for fifty years, my ships are untouchable.\"\n\n\"Father, your business is extinct, business is extinct.\"\n\n\"What nonsense.\"\n\n\"Have you not notice the storms, the quakes, the panic?!\"\n\n\"I'm not coming on a snivelling brat's lifeboat, and that's final.\"
codex.4f8e2b3e6c727493d961c153b6d8a581=Those seven years of turmoil, I really learned to live. Of course I had my lovely Savoie to keep my face looking fresh in the mornings (Horris had provided a wonderful en suite bathroom for me on the third deck). Brave Steed, who sadly never quite recovered from his wounded arm, taught me all he knew of engineering, and by the time of his death, I was competent enough to make repairs to Rosetta, my namesake. We buried Steed on an island, leaving a small stone to his memory.   \n\nDe Noc\\u00e9 steered us through the wildest tempests, rain so hard it ate into the deck, creatures so fierce and fanciful that dream and reality blurred. But De Noc\\u00e9 steadied his senses with liquor.\n\nAs for Horris, he is as industrious as they day I met him. Not once has he gloated over his revenge upon my father, but instead buried himself in work. Capulca has opened its doors to us, and we are happy to have fallen under the spell of the Pekoe.\n\nOf course I have not seen my father since. He may have survived the Hole in a ship of his own, but hubris rarely fails to punish its victims. I have offered a silent prayer to his memory, for though he was a cruel, stubborn and selfish man, I see many of his good qualities in myself and his grandchildren, our little Feathers.
codex.97019ad9efe4d07724b48c56524dcb63=I think it only right and fittin' I make my mark 'ere. \r\nI've lived life in toil, make no mistake, all the while knowing there's to be nothin' at the end of it for the likes of me. \r\n\r\nWell that won't do. I must have a piece of this \"immortality\", even if I must scriven in ink to get at it.\r\nI was born in 2800 precise, being the \"first glad baby of the century\" - so said my mother, though I know her to be false on at least a thousand counts, since I did not shoot out from her until the month of \\u00d6evel. \r\n\r\nStill, those early years were happy for my siblin's and I. The corn grew over and about us. I remember, we used to roll up the shuck paper, and steam fish within. \r\n\r\nMy brother and I'd scale the Cross Fields hillock, and look valley-long at the sights of windmills a-turnin', the bobbin' of boats on the river, and the long dunes that come between us and southern folk.
codex.927cd4787162bcefde8c9fc4845a99b9=As I oldened, I's made to do more farm work. Days're long, and once we'd tilled, sown, or watered, there followed little time for ought else.\nMother said our soil were the best in all Sabor, meanin', it were the best in all Foundation. But still we never held much corn over when it came time to collect. The God'nds came with they bags, and threw in our corn with less than half the love we gave to grow it. It withered any joy I took in the toil.\n \nI'cud scarcely stomach the days then, and father, though he winced at every stroke, used to bat me for mitchin' off. Instead of labourin', I'd play in the grey hollow with them wood doves, see. I found I could make them appear to disappear: a \"trick\" if you will. \n\nI tried it on all I met. The family bloody loved it in spring, when the eggs were painted, and the neighbours gathered to shatter them with their brooms. \n\nYears passed, and I conjured more distrac-shuns, oftentimes the tearing and folding of corn shucks, which baffled everyone as to the method (the secret was all in me hands). \nI practiced when I ought to have been in the fields. Father bat me into my twenties, but by then his stick'd gone soft, as it were.
codex.4db7de53fb0bee493d7553a09a378bb4=I learned little of farming, and a Pilipus can use little else. It troubled my mother, who said, \"if you don't expect to work, you shouldn't expect to feed.\" \r\nOne day, Cross Fields came together for harvest. Mannequins stuck the wagons, and the wall was built for steepling. Third, a pedestal was stood for funnymen. \r\nMy mother and sister excited me into performing. I told them \"I'm no funnyman\", but they wouldn't hear of it.\r\nI confess, there are moments of my illusyon that depend upon the titivation of an audience to laughter, such that they do not see the exercises of my hands. \r\nThis was excuse enough for the crowd, and the surprising arrival of my doves from nothing diminished all the competition! Many offered up the things they had brought to market as reward for the spectacle, and I was the talk of Cross Fields. \r\n\r\nAfter that, it grew beyond pastime. I'd visit the farms of the crescent, receiving whatever they'd to offer - supper, clothes they'd darned - in return for an evening's entertainment. \r\n\r\nFor many years did I make such amiable circuits. I needed only to provide for mesel', and in the evening I made merry on the wine slopes. The vintners treated me to it, for they had privilege, theirs being an endurin' commodity. 
codex.3c6bfa127de6357b0abdc30d9372d4d1=But summat awoke in me at thirty. I longed for company, and before long I'd taken a wife. Not long after that, came lit'luns. A zest filled me to brimmin' (I had their needs to account for, see) and I desired to grow an enterprise of my illusyon. \r\n\r\nI procur'd paper from the pappymill, ink from the sea-fishers, and I set about the manufacshure of handbills. I had them scattered in each place, writ with the particulars of my shewings. \r\nWhen I next performed, oh how they did flock! So many, I couldn't hope to greet 'em all. I decided that thereafter an entrance levy should be applied in gen'ral terms, comprisin' whatever produce each guest could muster. I own, there were murmurin's about the propriety of it even then, but I had to make a livin' somehow.  \r\n\r\nMy wife, while not a beauty, became greatly important. More so p'raps, than I. She saw to the lit'luns, but still found time to barter with our neighbours. What good were five boxes of corn, when we could only use one? The wife saw that livestock and supplies came our way, and even wooden toys for the lit'luns. \r\n\r\nMuch of the overrun went to mother and father, who had waited so long to see a benefit in me! I used wood from down the lane to construct a fine dwellin' for our young family, with lands all around.
codex.ff65d5fddf6af56671b178b578937198=It was about this time that trouble brewed. When God'nds came for the tithe, they saw how well we was doin', and were curious as to how. I told the story plainly, and they stowed their weapons and let the matter lie, though they took far more in tithes than was truthful due.\n\nLittle dee' I know, but among the crowd of my next show, was a snooper. He must have view'd the entrance levy as a wrongdoin', because not long after, the God'nds returned and placed me under seizure. \n\nWhat followed was a disquietin' time. \nI was taken to Momoros - a breath-relievin' sight. Ships in the skies! A golden age, a time of travels that'd all but passed us Pilipai by. \nBefore me came a council, dressed with distincshun. I thought I was there to answer to a crime, but was only a passenger, as they squawked and hustled for position.\n\nIn no time, it was pronounced an \"you-nanny-mouse\" vote that I should suffer gaol for half a moon, and have me belongin's scattered. \nIt was pronounc'd my \"greed was vile\", and that all Saborians, god or mortal, must resist temptation. I was taken to gaol forthwith.\n\nI heard by missive that my wife had taken the lit'luns away. They'd gone back to Cross Fields to earn \"an honest livin',\" as she put it. \nI could not counter that, for in her eye, I'd let her down. Yet, in my eye, if there's a crime, it were committed by Sabor what stole my livelihood.
codex.0fa062b8262c1fb21252c99260320e55=When I were cut loose I had not a trifle to my name, and I lamented that I must return to a humbler life. \nAs I departed the gaol by the gate, a pale woman approached me. Strange voice she did have, claimin' to be steward of a \"frillship\". A vessel of \"significant 'portions.\" \n\nShe'd borne witness to my trial, and knew everythin' on the matter - and every other matter too. Not a lot of it stuck to me, except that she wished for my presence aboard her vessel, whereabout I could continue my favourite illusyons in return for gold. Gold! \n\nIt all sounded rather plum. I was even given a warm coat, assuredly lined with the long-neck wool of far Pin. We took to the shipyard, where the vessel was moored. Never in all my days.. This ship, the Diva, was vast! \n\nWe broke from Momoros, and I was skyborne for the first time in my life. The itin'ry was detailed, and I would begin at the foot o' the bill, to \"learn my craft\". Not much room for learnin' so late in life I thought - I was then thirty-six or thereabouts - but illusyon was my love, and those exercises of the hands were somewhat known to me already.
codex.217500f82c720e1447c753ee7e950eef=But oh, how I do miss it now. Thin bright air, the daily paramboolations around deck, the ado-ray-shun of the crowd.    \n\nI made friends readily. They'd never known a Pilipus, and hearing the story of my lost family, sent sympathetic glances toward me. After a year of revels, I took up with an old Mellifluan girl, whose talent was to shake her ample belly in cadence with music. Music like none I'd ever heard!\n\nThe days flowed like the wine, and stagin's were so frequent that I both  perfected and grew weary of my routine. To address fatigue, I embark'd upon new conjurayshuns - the vanishin' of grander subjects than yellow doves. \nBeing in the ratmen's kingdom, and spying there that magnificent bug-riddle baton protrudin' from the sand, I decided I must use it. \nI claim it was this trick, involvin' the \"lighter of lamps\", that elevated me in the minds of all concerned. \n\nI'd have the captain steer the Diva so that this landmark was in plain sight. Then erecting a sizeable screen of linens across the deck, I obscur'd it from the audience, so that only the insects glowed through. When the fabric dropped, the insects were aboard ship, and the tower itself nowhere to be seen! I'll not tell you how, an illusyonist never gives up his secrets.
codex.ada58e78ff29537c8d8ec910687e6b7c=After fifteen years aboard the Diva, I was known to most of Foundation as \"Phantom Hands\" on account of my dextrous illusyons. Known equally well, because I used it for patterin', were my complaints regardin' the God'nds, and their treatment of my family.\nI was vouched for by some Verduban friends, who I did tell about life as a Pilipus. The horror of it confounded 'em, and they soon petition'd Sabor, havin' agency in the writing of newspappy articles.\n\nThe matter inflat'd far beyond my means. Sabor, hearin' their good name dragged in dirt, gave apology, with which my friends were still not content. I'd not invited their protestations, yet they argued my cause longer and louder than I'd ever think to.\n\nSoon I was invited by the Utopian herself, to the Stalk in Redusa, to settle. Eager to see the matter closed, I made my way to the capital.
codex.ff76666aef5040a475987b45c53276e0=As it turned out, this 'ere Utopian asked me if I'd be an hon'rary citizen. She said I was god, and that my illusyons had brought glory to Sabor. She said my wife and lit'luns could be made citizens too, and I'd be free to live in a city habitat with all my needs met.\n\"Redusa?\" I said.\n\"Wherever you wish,\" she said.  \nOf course I agreed to it without delay. I longed to be back on home soil, it being in my blood, and restorin' my family. \n\nMy newspappy friends ditched me when they found out, what with the \"hippocrissy\". My shipmates too, wondered how I could \"live a lie\", and so the Diva sailed on without me. \n\nAt first, it was a fine life. My distrac-shuns proved popular as ever, and I was taken with the city and my spacious residence. \nBut when I inquired as to the wellbein' of my wife and lit'luns, I was inform'd they'd long been dead. Died of the wastin' disease, so common among Pilipai. \n\nThere began despair, for they could not now come to the risin' place with me. The whole circumstance contriv'd by the Utopian, who'd've known full well of their passin' when we met. It made me wonder to what other dishonesties I was bound.
codex.fff8aba245a38027d0fcfcfa6bd05a21=It was on the occasion of my fiftieth birthday that I saw through the trick. An illusyon played upon me! I had forgot the concord by which citizens abide - that being of middle age, I must take my life at the risin' place. \n\nThe whole scheme to make me citizen existed just to be rid of me sooner! \"I'll have none of it,\" I said, \"I'd rather return to the fields and drove sheep\". \nI could've died an hon'rable citizen of Sabor, but I gambled on a few more years of shame, a Pilipus again.\n\nWell, nature has been kind. I am seventy-two this spring. My hands are bony from toil, and I cannot now perform my illusyons, even were I allowed. My memories of the Diva fade, and though I still pine for for the family I lost to the wastin', I'm comforted that my brother still lives, and that he has some toil for me at Cross Fields. 
codex.8cd14c0bebb19c45ac7f6f15c00929fa=(Translated from an Ishgiruan diary)\n\nLeti Mabonie is my real name, though for a long time I went as \"Selena\".\n\nIt was after a race that I was first invited to meet the Snake. A little outbuilding of the imperial complex, where his hench-geezers squinted at me in the sun.\n\n\"He thinks you're quick, he wants you. Do us a favour, and come out of the light.\"\n\nSo I went into darkness. \nDown some steps, and through a cool cellar stocked with beer and pickles. There was a chair in the room, and a pinhole of sky lit it meaningfully.      \n\nI sat down, and they gave me terms - what seemed a good offer. I was asked to sign a contract stamped with the seals of the Empress, Gloam, and the Elder of Pin. I signed it, writing \"Selena\" on the paper, instead of Leti. \nAlmost as soon as I had done that, I was hoisted up by the arms. Another door opened, and I was carried through it. More steps, coiling tightly down. Then the grip loosened, the hench-geezers left, and I thought I was alone. \nBut in the darkness, a chipping sound, then a spark that echoed all around. A flaming match drops and roars straight back up from a lantern pot swimming with oil. \n\n\"Fire,\" said Snake, \"Is what separates us from the beasts. But beasts we are still. We are brutal, we are selfish, we take for ourselves and don't give back.\"\n\nThen he gave me the knife.
codex.8e1298ddf7edf57619b11aad1f7887ef=I alight at Momoros skyway and look for the woman in blue robes. She is airside as expected. I stop near her and bend down as if looking for something in my bag.\n\n\"I'm sure it's here somewhere,\" I say.\n\nThe woman looks around casually. She waits for a group of academy students to push by, then she says, \"Oh you've dropped something!\"\n\n\"Oh yes, thank you,\" I say, picking up the little book that fell from her sleeve.\n\nThen we exchange quick smiles, and I walk to the gate. I hang back far enough from the booth that they can't see the paling cream on my face, and not so far as to appear awkward. \n\n\"Identification please,\" says the godhand.\n\nHopefully, I hand over the book of entitlement. Don't let me down, I say to him in my head. Just in case he does, my hand comes to rest upon the knife hidden in the soft excess of my robe. But the guard returns my papers, happy they are in order.  \n\n\"We are god,\" he says. Another little test.\n\n\"We are god,\" I say. The two-pip border guard nods, and the gate opens.
codex.17186e5d00ffd7f4b64495fb4b3f3e89=Oro and I have light-brown skin. We are convincing-looking Saborians, what with a bit of paling make-up. That's why they made Sabor our specialism. We kept the same hours, had the same tutors. We exercised together, we spent the night together. I never loved him, I took pity on him - he was a gullible soul even then. But that doesn't make doing what I have to do agreeable. \n\nIn the centre of Momoros there is panic. A Verduban suicider set off a bomb in the precinct. They should be used to it by now, but they aren't. The panic abates when a loudspeaker announcement is made.\n\nCitizens, do not try to assist, they are god now, rasps the voice. \nThe wounded will be left to die, and the godhands will clear away the bodies. They have a hard job, the godhands, but then they are hard people. In some odd way I respect them; I think they know what's really going on in Sabor.\n\nI head to Pilipai town, taking the elevator down to the green carpet below the city. My contact Thirsus is hovering nearby. I slip down a sidestreet, and he follows. We wind up by a forge, the clank of metal enough to cover our exchange. \n\n\"Calm down,\" I say.\n\nHe is thin, and his eyes are desperate. The lines around his mouth form a taut bracket.\n\n\"They'll hurt my family.\"\n\n\"All the more reason to be calm.\"\n\nThirsus gulps dryly, then he gives me what I'm after. \n\n\"He's in North-East Five.\"\n\n\"Where exactly?\"\n\n\"The cells. The Terminal cells.\"
codex.e057d457e0ac1875384cd55453d46ec7=There is no time to thank Thirsus, or to tell him his family will be ok. I don't often lie, if silence is enough. I have to worry about me, you see. This is my last job, and then I'm out. Back to Selene in the meadow. \r\n\r\nI take the elevator up to North-East Five. The sky is fresher and bluer, the happy people stroll together. Either they have not heard news of the terror attack, or they do not need to care. \r\n\r\nI follow the marker stones denoting the location of the Terminal, and once I reach it, I watch the entrance door for seven guard cycles. Then I head to the hotel, and I feel uneasy but I don't know why.\r\n\r\n\"You seem dark,\" says the hotelier. I realise she means my skin.\r\n\r\n\"I'm from Conos,\" I say. \r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" she says knowingly, though I know she has never been, \"Book, please.\"\r\n\r\nShe looks at it. Types like her can be more careful than border guards, and for a moment she frowns, but then she takes her stylus and strikes a line through the yellow stamp on the third page. She returns it to me.\r\n\r\n\"And what assignment brings you here?\" she says, more cheerfully now. I visualise a stab wound in Oro Mounteback's neck. \r\n\r\n\"I'm just here for the night,\" I say, \"I work in gems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fascinating!\" she lies, \"Upstairs. The second door.\"
codex.dc8adf07adda566019199cca1f38bdf9=I take my things up to the room. It is decorated like every other Saborian hotel room. I put my clothes on the chair and take a shower, careful not to let the water wash over the make-up. I ruffle my hair, wrap myself in a towel, then I walk up to the window. It is covered by a single opaque blind. Instead of peeling back one corner to look at the man I know has been following me, I yank the string, and glare brazenly out into the piazza, careful to avoid direct eye-contact with him. He is surprised, and moves casually but briskly out of sight.\n\nI watch people for a little while, to see if he, or anyone else comes back, but they do not. I close the curtain and open my bag. I pull a file from the secret sleeve the Warlock of the Hem sewed into it for me. I read over the words again. \n\n\"Exus Levit, Saborian counterintelligence. Risk Factor: Grave.\"\n\nBut I have to concentrate on Oro.\nI keep thinking about him, I keep thinking about how stupid he is. I wake early, and since there is no sign of Levit on the walkway, head out.
codex.22fa56bbf639363c8a5c23babefcd042=I return to North-East Five and watch the Terminal. The godhand looks sleepy, but it's not enough to give me a chance. I cut through the crowd to the other side, and look up. There's a whirr of propellers, and I see the red-black livery of a gunship. I mould myself to the bulwark of the building and remain still until the noise has passed. \r\n\r\nI put my hands on the wall. It is almost smooth, but there is a horizontal ridge-line offering some grip. I have a quick look around, before palming up to it. It's hard work, but I'm only light. I drive up again to a section of embossed brickwork and I'm away. \r\n\r\nI shuffle around a right-angle corner of the building so that I'm sure I cannot be seen from the thoroughfare. Behind me now is a drop to tiny trees and parkland below, and I can see over the hills to the dunes. There's no wind, but I'm tense, and the grip is thin. \r\n\r\nI am halfway-through the ascent when another gunship scuts overhead. I try to remain still, but I'm exposed. The ship hangs for an eerily long time and I begin to worry. My fingers are trembling but I can't afford to look up. Finally the engine noise fades. Then I hear a clattering inside the wall, and I know I'm on the right track; there must be an opening up above for the gunships. \r\n\r\nExhausted, I reach the top platform. I see the control tower, and roll out of sight. I take a dash of water from my flask, and peer around the low wall. In the centre of the roof terrace is a big hole.
codex.3834bd624468450c2841519138f33d75=I crawl on all fours until I'm beside the hole, and I look in. I'm too high to be noticed if I'm quick. I swing backward under the lip, and slip between the mesh of titanium support struts. I attach a grapple to a thick beam running the length of the hangar ceiling. \r\n\r\nI chalk my hands from the pouch, then I swing across to the far wall. I get a better view of the Terminal interior from here. A couple of docked ships, a series of ramps and walkways leading to the various subsections, just like the blueprints I'd seen. I drop down to an empty level, and cling to the topside of a beam.\r\n\r\n\"Bandinian?\" I hear a two-pip godhand shout below, \"get him to a cell\".\r\n\r\nI watch as the young man tries to resist - a shock to the neck pacifies him. I ab-hop carefully down the interior wall, jabbing my knife in the cracks until I am within reach of the two-pip and his prisoner. As they turn, I drop in behind. They proceed through the red-lit landing towards the secure area.  \r\n\r\n\"Clearance?\" says another godhand up ahead, and I duck behind an open door. \r\n\r\n\"74X\" says the guard, and they are buzzed through. I don't have time to be looking for another way in, so I wait for the three-pip to turn his head, before plunging into his neck. Once he is completely dead, I heave his body into an empty crate under the stairs and close the lid. \r\nA flicker of guilt.
codex.42de573def06892e05f3a549972a4012=I press open the door, and the whole floor is bright white with newly-constructed cubicle cells. There's no sign of life. High Security. Three-Pip Only, reads a sign to the right. I skip through, and think these cells empty too, until I hear voices.\r\n\r\n\"But what can you give me?\" says Oro.\r\n \r\n\"What we promised. You'll become a citizen, you'll have a quiet habitat in Agbana, free passage back and forth.\" \r\n\r\nThe negotiator is Exus Levit, the man who followed me to the hotel. \r\n\r\n\"How can I be sure you'll keep your word?\" says Oro. I can only see the left side of his face, and a fatuous eye, behind the thick cell bar. \r\n\r\n\"You don't have any choice Mounteback. Take the offer, or leave it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to speak to the Admiral.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Admiral left the matter to me.\"\r\n\r\nI hear Oro sigh, like he sighed before, when I told him I didn't love him and never had. \r\n\r\n\"I don't have the Rebus,\" he says sadly. \r\n\r\n\"You don't have it?!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got the Sky Hulk blueprints.\"\r\n\r\nLevit's anger makes his laugh sharp, \"blueprints are worthless. We got them from Gall long before your master paid for them. You know, Mounteback, I don't think this is going to work out.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment I wondered if Levit would do my job for me.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait, there's something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"It better be good.\"\r\n\r\nI knew what was coming. It was the big one and I had to stop it.
codex.f8d7321fb725f8b4da43c15680a3261c=I kill Levit clean and quick. Usually killing troubles me, but I've read his file. I feel nothing for the bigot. Then it's just me and Oro. He tries to look pleased to see me, but his smile is crumpled, like a frillship clown's.\r\n\r\n\"Selena! Oh thank the Empress, help me get out of here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can drop the act Oro. We both know it's over.\"\r\n\r\nHe waits. I wait. He slumps back in his cell. \r\n\r\n\"If only you knew, Selena.\"\r\n\r\n\"My real name is Leti.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think mine is Oro?\" he chuckles.\r\n\r\n\"I know it is.\"\r\n\r\nHe looks tired, but I have to be careful. There is a new conviction, a spark of something I'd never seen in him.\r\n\r\n\"You know what happens now,\" I say.\r\n\r\nHe nods.\r\n\r\n\"Just tell me why,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"There is something here I believe in.\"\r\n\r\n\"For your boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"All for him, Selena, all for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's had a hard life.\" I think of the boy who embraced Oro as we set off for the Capulca mission. He used to live in the low-town with his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Is he here?\"\r\n\r\nOro nods. \"There's good clean water here for everyone, and food. It's fair - absolutely fair, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't looked at it hard enough. What about Melliflua? Don't you remember what Menizes said? They're going to turn her into a great big Atlas mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a necessary evil.\"\r\n\r\nHe takes a deep breath. \r\n\r\n\"I'm ready now, just do what you need to do Selena.\"\r\n\r\nI approach the cell. It'll be hard, but I have him where I want him. \r\n\r\n\"We are god,\" he says.
codex.698941e680eca581c10538d302e71b28=I remember Oro twitching as he died, and then a look of faint contentment on his face - some final vision of him and his boy skipping happily through a Saborian arboretum. A misguided man, but at least he found something to cling on to. More than I could say for myself. Too many bodies. I dropped Snake's knife and began to sob. \n\nI should have focused. If I'd gone out the way I came in, I'd be on a skyship by sundown. But the alarm sounded. I heard the pounding of godhand boots. They would be upon me in moments. I couldn't think, I kept breathing too fast, I was panicking.\n\nThen I was soothed. A clean pain lanced between my ribs, and a hand reached over my mouth. \n\n\"Hush,\" said a bewitching voice, and she moved me to one side. I was paralyzed. \n\nI watched the godhands stream in as if they were a dream. Somehow they found the bodies, but they didn't see us. They looked and looked, and I felt like shouting, \"I'm here, I'm here. Why can't you see me!?\" because then I knew it would all be over sooner. \n\nI could no longer feel it, but I think the hand was still over my mouth. As they dragged the bodies away, I couldn't keep my eyes open any more.
codex.00a898c782887debe4ba361fe97b2793=I wake up in darkness. I feel the hand over my mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Mnnnh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush. Stay quiet.\"\r\n\r\nThen the hand is removed, and I'm breathing through my mouth again. The air is close around me, there is a slight give in the cold metal under my hands, must be a vent of some kind. Then comes a light behind me from the tiniest lantern you've ever seen. It lights a feline face of considerable experience. \r\n\r\n\"I am Gri-Liif, Queen of the Shamoe,\" say the crinkled and sensuous lips.\r\n\r\n\"Shamoe..\" I whisper to myself, and the stories of my childhood come flooding back. \r\n\r\n\"You have a wound. I had to stick the blade deep, else numbness would not swallow you, but you will come to no harm.\" \r\n\r\n\"Where are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly out.\" \r\n\r\nI crawl on ahead, before the vent veers right. The light from outside is bright. I peer through the slats, where the evening sunlight streams warmly down on the stones so they smell of summer.\r\n\r\n\"Sun is bad hot,\" she says, \"we wait for dark.\"
codex.68e5f47d02a20f8c719c19bfc8b527c2=\"How...?\"\n\n\"Not telling you how,\" she says, \"but I say why. Same as you, I kill Oro before he talk.\"\n\n\"The prophecy?\"\n\n\"The prophecy.\"\n\nShe looks at me curiously, and I know she is deciding whether or not to kill me too.\n\n\"The prophecy is unnatural,\" she says, \"it must not come to pass.\"\n\nIt was in her interest that neither side won this war. She could have been playing each side off against the other for years.\n\"Why would you save me?\"\n\n\"I am not cruel, I do not kill for sport. Besides, you are weak, I know your methods.\" \n\nWhen the light fades we remove the grille and climb out of the vent. I never saw a creature move so fast as Gri-Liif, let alone of her age. I try to keep up as she streaks through Momoros avenues like she was born here. We climb into an elevator, and I press for down. At the bottom, she stalks out into open country. She's ditched her skyship out here, I know it.
codex.ab62d75e6747dd503af99681dcd86616=I can't sleep, so I came outside to write this. I'm looking up, and it's so dark but for the landing lights, flickering some sky-vessel home to banquets and music. I want to get out of the low-town, it's dark and dirty, it stinks, and I feel ashamed to be alive. \r\nBut where do I go, how do I get there? I feel like a villain. We all feel like villains, shuttered away beneath the shanty stacks of Ten-Rui, so the puppet Empress and her stooges don't have to see us. Oh how I wish for an Empress like Getta Renata instead. \r\n\r\nNorry died today! I'm taking up the pen, there's no-one I can talk to about it. He was a Tarrery lad, the youngest, the strongest of us. They found him by the old temple fountains, under a pillar. I loved to swim in those fountains, and so did he. The ocean shines on that little man, gods bless him with a quick death. \r\nHa! I wish I could believe in the gods, but not even they belong to us. The Nabobs pilfered those idols from the Gall to decorate their halls, just like the took everything from us.\r\n  \r\nI'm so alone. I love the little ones, I do. If only I could meet a girl, take a piece of someone else with me when I die. I'm waiting for the big one, we all know it is coming. J.
codex.6f982431852c9e1cb28b948dc33869e2=Sini is a blast of fresh air, she is sitting with the others now. I'm at the top of the shelter, and the corrugate is bowing under my weight. I'm looking down at the top of her head, which has a very straight line of olive skin through the middle, like the head of a brush from which all her dark hair sprouts.\r\n\r\nThe children are knotting strings with glass, they are too tired to mine. The mines are closing soon, moving up north. I hope they never have to do it again, I can't watch their little grubby legs struggling in the dust. That surly hullabaloo pays nothing. He says the children don't bring enough stones, so they aren't worth their wages, but to me, they're priceless.\r\n\r\nBanton visited! They love his stories, even if some of his Cha-boots are a bit rude. He even let me play his pati-pikk. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. The sound is so sweet. He had to go back to Kubo, but he said he wished he could do more for us. I say we need to learn to help ourselves, find something else to keep them from mining.
codex.ed3af0b9c507b6e26e5c0646bafc5180=Sini woz here. I found your diary! Thought I'd read it since you've been watching me a lot up there. It's not that I care, I just need to see what exactly you wrote -\r\n\r\nI have a line on the top of my head like a brush? How is that worth writing about? I checked your head and you have the same thing - when you finally fell asleep - during the best part of the day. No wonder you don't sleep at night. You know the small ones are much harder to handle in the day - lazy boy. \r\n\r\nDo they feel like our children to you? I'm not suggesting... just think we are responsible, and they need us.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the city stinks too.
codex.b920b0e67250a00471913deab8d2b1cb=Hello I'm Alphom, I got to write in the diary! Well, Sini is writing for me, because so far I can only read. Mr. J is still asleep, I think he must be very tired. We are all tired too, but it's good to play with glass. Sini read me about Norry. It made me sad to remember because Norry is my best friend. I'm going to see him again one day. Sini says she will name our school after him, when we make our school. \r\nThe main fact about me is I told everyone about the gods, because they don't know about Pekoe gods. Hatep is the biggest, he is a snake. Dad said we were lucky there were no snakes in Ten-Rui, but I actually quite like snakes, even if they bite and people die (a bit morbid but Alphom insisted I leave this in - Sini).

No we are not in love, I just thought her hair was interesting, so give up bullying me you little tykes! \r\n\r\nI know it's sad about Norry, so why don't we all write in here?

In the tale of the kindly tailor, the rich must be punished for their crimes.\r\n\r\nMy message is, that if I die, I will come back and haunt you like a ghost and knock your horrible buildings down.  \r\n\r\nAlso we have the help of a real Warlock! The Dragon-Dog has scary armour, but he never raises his sword to us. He plans to help us, a real Warlock helping us!

codex.068555a03e2339e636a67bcb3695e21a=Log Book, Captain Ajaccus.\n\nDay 1822.\nShe left the shipyard in the year 2995, the last of her kind. When I say that, I mean they took care over her every rivet and screw. She is a goliath-class ship that could have felt empty, but they gave her a soul. \nStill, little did we imagine that twenty years on, the Epilomelos would be perfectly intact, and showing no signs of fatigue. Even my crew remain largely unchanged, in terms of personnel at least.\n\n\"It's fine. I'm happy,\" Clevedore said to me, as we pulled away from Momoros, where we had been conducting routine repairs. \n\"We've been away so long it doesn't feel like home anymore.\"\nClevedore loves a controversy, safe in her seat behind the main gun.\n\n\"Time has changed you,\" first officer Cait goaded gently, \"I remember the young woman who kissed the angel on her lapels, and knew all the old songs.\" \nClevedore just grinned. \n\nI don't know if it's Sabor or us that has altered course these long years. Either way, there's a yawning gap between our original mission - to observe and report on Foundation - and the Stalk's present desire for us to exploit it.\n\nIt is lucky we still have the Epilomelos. Each day, she helps break down the walls between Sabor and the outside world, just as Epilomelos himself once sought to unify the discordant cities of the desert. Ours is a noble cause, we seek peace and understanding.
codex.fe6c0122400494a1b3eafe380655912a=Day 1829.\nAfter a week of travel and petty engagements, we find ourselves on a diplomatic mission over Verduban territory. The intention of an upcoming meeting is to discuss sharing a supply of untapped Atlas in the cold north sea.\n\nCommunication has proved difficult, but we are making progress. We arranged to meet an aide of the House of Ice outside the citadel at Muskdog, and before I set off, my culture officer Dormio tried to offer some advice;\n\n\"...and they will expect you to wear simple dress. They are moderate-\"\n\n\"-I have heard stories of their so-called 'moderation',\" I chuckled.\n\n\"The stories of nudity are, generally, unfounded, sir,\" he smirked, \"we need you to be on best behaviour. If we can guarantee Atlas here, the Economist, and the Committee will be appeased, and we can continue on our way.\"\n\n\"We have a duty to the Verdubans' best interests. We cannot coerce them into accepting terms that are heavily weighted in our favour.\"\n\n\"We have the authority to use-\"\n\n\"-that's enough Dormio!\" I smiled, \"If the negotiations fail, you can blame it on me. Now...what's the food like in Muskdog?\"\n\nHe's a good man, Dormio, and like all of us he's worried about our livelihood, but I can't allow personal gain to interfere with what I consider our moral obligation - to treat all the people we meet with equal respect.
codex.ab1b90e971687d98cda81f19e40be2ea=Day 1844.\nAfter the failure of the negotiations at Verduba, there was understandable concern among the crew that we would be summoned to Momoros and lose our commission.\nFortunately, the admiralty want to keep us together. Methusan's popularity grows, and he won't risk upsetting the nanban cart by decommissioning his flagship. \n\nHowever, we were told this was our last chance. They sent us south, to Bandinia. It is always a troubled place, in no small part due to us Saborians. It is a mission requiring the utmost delicacy, and I regret that they have given us authority to declare war if negotiations with King Orthosa are unsuccessful. War with Bandinia is an eventuality I refuse, even as a last resort.
codex.e7f9b7843fb751ef03a919d38856a594=Day 1845.\nWe approached the Bandinian frontier from the warm sea, and over the studded desert. As the light was beginning to fade, the jewels in the desert twinkled. Our course was direct, and we were surprised to find a vessel in our path, not far north-east of Darat. \n\n\"It is Bandinian,\" said Cait, \"Maneuverable. We should be cautious, sir.\"\n\nCait's prudence has saved my life, and the life of my crew on more than one occasion. While we don't always agree, she is the fire to my ice, the rage to my calm. I am grateful to have her by my side. \n\n\"Very well. Patri, man the lights if you will.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nPatri rotated the spotlight upon the other ship, then at my command, blinked some code; We are a peaceful Saborian vessel, we mean you no harm. There was a pause of some length before there were signs of movement on the rogue ship's deck. A light flickered on, and in a few moments we received their reply; Prepare to be boarded.
codex.b24e8e7330ae18f2ffcb773bda101d14=Day 1845 (continued...)\n\n\"They're powering up engines,\" said Cait.\n\nSeveral hatches opened along their bow, and cannons nosed out in our direction.\n\n\"Options?\"\n\n\"We are goliath class, sir. We have a good deal more firepower.\"\n\n\"Hold fire,\" I said, \"Send the message again.\"\n\nPatri flashed the light; We are a peaceful Saborian vessel, we mean you no harm.\nThere was no effect, the ship maintained course. \n\n\"We are wide open to attack, sir\" said Clevedore, \"by boarding, or from their guns. Suggest evasive maneuver, then priming the cannons!\"\n\n\"Maintain current heading. Do nothing else,\" I remember shouting, and I was right. I was right.\n\nThe hostile dance amounted to little more than a fly-by, our dorsals practically touching the Bandinian ship as it passed. Hanging there from the rigging, was a slight and bare-chested boy of no more than fifteen. He gazed unblinkingly up at us, chewing, admiring our ship. It was in that moment I knew he was the only one aboard.
codex.fc79392c0eec82994f6f26af042b94b9=Day 1851\nWe were diverted to the city of Driss. I am told that the capital, Darat, is unsafe. Rioters there protest the mining of Atlas, which they believe is causing the quakes - and I wondered if that might affect our meeting. It was therefore agreed that Vilanthrus of Driss, a senior counsel, would open his doors to us instead. \n\n\"Welcome,\" our host said, \"please Captain, sit down and share a drink. I've arranged a pleasant stay for your crew outside the city, in the desert garden of Calipolon\".\n\nI was surprised at the considerable welcome party crowding the low-vaulted throne room, nobles and significant persons of the state. Among them, a young man stood out. He had fine clothes, and the unmistakably cynical eyes of a born patrician. \n\n\"That's a kind offer, but unnecessary. I will need my crew's expertise in these negotiations, you see.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it is not allowed. I was told by your admiral himself, that a private agreement would be reached between the two of us,\" said Vilanthrus haughtily.
codex.267938c5b27b267d3cb17afc08b3e158=Day 1851 (continued...)\n\nI must have let out a visible sigh. What had commander Methusan agreed this time? Vilanthrus eyed me strangely. \n\n\"Very well. Leave us,\" I said to the crew. Cait looked irritable as she left, and mouthed something. The nobles too were hustled out, all but one remained; the smartly-dressed young man I had noticed. \n\nVilanthrus twizzled his moustache. Then he stood up and went to the cabinet to pour himself some wine. The young man strode over confidently, and sat upon Vilanthrus' seat.\n\n\"I am King Orthosa,\" he said quickly, \"very brave of you, to come here.\"\n\n\"Brave?\" I said, and I made a quick move for the door. The guards barred my way.\n\n\"No need to escape Captain. You have nothing to fear, from us at least.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" \n\nOrthosa laughed, \"all in good time Captain, but for now, relax, enjoy the delights of the palace.\"
codex.d56a9789f339c28daa9ad01fdfd04f50=Day 1852\nI was subjected to every temptation last evening. It was as depraved as a Mellifluan wedding. This morning, I was yanked out of my bed at first light and thrown before Orthosa.\n\n\"Tell me Captain, are you ready to negotiate?\"\n\nI did not reply.\n\n\"What are your terms?\"\n\nI rose to kneel, whereupon a spear was held to my neck. A mistake and I would be dead.\n\n\"I... am simply under instruction to request that, since we have provided Bandinia significant resources to mine Atlas, that a little more of it be diverted back to Sabor.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Orthosa cheerfully, but Vilanthrus' grim expression proved the seriousness of the situation, \"and if we refuse your offer?\"\n\n\"Do you refuse?\" I said, at which point the guard was instructed to kick me hard in the ribs.\n\n\"Answer the question, Captain.\"\n\nRemembering stories of ancient Bandinians sacrificing Saborian envoys, I chose to tell a lie.\n\n\"It would disappoint us, nothing more. The negotiations will end, and my crew and I will return to our ship. You will not hear from us again. \n\n\"So the reports about your crew are true,\" muttered Vilanthrus, drawing back a curtain.\n\nStanding in the revealed archway was Methusan, the Saborian fleet admiral. He dropped his cowl and stroked his white-streaked beard. This whole encounter was a test of my allegiance to the Stalk. A test I had failed.
codex.fc46785f2e172c0ee99e3934df61dc3c=Day 1852 (continued)\r\n\"Oh dear Captain. That is not the answer we Saborians were hoping for,\" he began, jutting his chin upward. \r\n\"Orthosa here is doing a fine job already. In the last year alone, we have recouped three-fifths of all Atlas mined in Bandinia. By 3020, we will have the lion's share.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the will of the people? The riots?\" I said.\r\n\r\nMethusan put his arm on the back of the throne, and young Orthosa looked smug. I could see Methusan was acting out the role of the encouraging father, at least, while Orthosa was still useful to him.  \r\n\r\n\"If they don't know what's good for them, then Orthosa here shall legislate. We can make them work if we need to, just like it used to be. In return for these small sacrifices, the King and Vilanthrus here have the freedom of a sublime palace, and everything else they desire. Just think Captain Ajaccus, that could have been you. You could have had my special favour, if only you and your damned crew did as you were told.\"\r\n\r\nOrthosa raised an eyebrow. I hung my head in shame. What had become of my people? Saborian-Bandinian relations plunging into darkness anew, and I, powerless to stop it.\r\n\r\nThe door burst open. It was Cait. She raised her crossbow and fired. The bolt stuck Vilanthrus in the neck, and he fell, retching blood. \r\n\r\n\"Run Captain!\" she cried, as the guards rushed to attack her. \r\n\r\n\"No!\" I cried, rushing to her defence. I hauled the guards off her. Then the others arrived and the guards were overwhelmed. When they had been disarmed, their hands were bound. 
codex.554a188a0ecb5b6b2a19229049e2b933=Day 1852 (continued)\n\n\"How did you know?\" I said.\n\n\"It was obvious from the start,\" she said, \"but seeing the barbed fences at those so-called \"gardens\" of Calipolon made our minds up for us.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, and I'm grateful. Now, we must deal with Methusan...\"  \n \nBut King Orthosa and Admiral Methusan had fled to the balcony, where Methusan's skyship had been waiting. They'd be back with an army. \n\n\"Dormio,\" said Cait, \"he gave them a dossier on us.\"\n\n\"Dormio?\"\n\n\"He betrayed us, Captain.\"\n\n\"Worse, he's betrayed the Epilomelos.\"\n\nCait and I went to the balcony and looked over Driss, less a city, more a labyrinth of scars. Children consumptive, begging for food, broken by Atlas. The goners, drifting the streets in their last days, speaking the words of the penitents. Slaves marching to camps like the one at Calipolon, the eerie clank of their chains on cobble.    \n\n\"Dormio's actions are unforgivable, but the traitors outweigh those who know what it is to be god. We have to take our chances alone. We are fugitives, and we have to take the Epilomelos far away.\"
codex.d40e93e1262324d7fad40b816615a290=Epilogue\n\nAh the old log book. \nThere were deserters. But for those on the bridge, we had no choice, our names were already mud. Clevedore tore up her book of entitlement, and the rest of us followed. All we had was each other.\n\nWe settled in Verduba, where they sympathised. Doors were opened to us. The hardship drew Cait and I close, and we took up an offer of a plot of land, and built a cabin together. We started a family, and we looked after the children together (most un-Saborian). \n\nThirteen years have passed since we landed the Epilomelos for the last time, but you can be sure her heart is still beating. I keep her under canvas, but our son keeps nagging me to dust her off and get her airborne again. If the war comes to Verduba, we'll have to.\n\nClevedore dropped by today. Learning some Verduban helped her make good, and now she is a senior figure in Verduban government. Today, she brought me a clipping from the newspaper, and pinned it to our wall;\n\n\"King Orthosa of Bandinia, and his trusted aide Vilanthrus have been killed in a palace coup. Reporters from the palace in Driss say that they were drowned in a vat of wine by protesters who had stormed into the building. The attacks are the culmination of years of oppression by the puppet King Orthosa, who is widely believed to have been in the employ of the Stalk Committee. \n\nSabor's recent and complete withdrawal from Bandinia following the seismic devastation in Darat seems to have left the King open to attack from all sides.\"
codex.565691e9475574abf0fb92f7185d954d=The music dapples the walls of the Two Moons bar. Curled shadows creep and wane from view. Alika, a man with a brass moustache, unclips a cigar from his jacket lining, and presents it to the young lady. She stings him across the cheek with the flat of her palm. He lights the cigar easily and lets out a puff of smoke. The party stops around them for a moment, then carries on - worse things happen in the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Can't we even talk?\" he says, as if he's said it a hundred times. \r\nHer name is Lois. She shrugs, and mooches out to the veranda, where black hulls are silhouetted against the orange sky, and the air smells of gunpowder. Alika stalks behind her, and appropriates her waist. He crinkles his brass moustache like a sleazy card. But she rips it from his upper lip, and tosses it over the balcony. It bounces off the apartment walls and down onto the road. \"Hey!\" comes a disgruntled shout from below.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was hardly necessary,\" says Alika.\r\n\r\n\"Stop it,\" says Lois. \r\n\r\nHe looks younger without the moustache, though there is a leathery pouch in each cheek where cigar butts are accustomed to rest. Lois keeps her back to him and looks out over the city, so she can dream a dream of a free Melliflua.
codex.5f0f82272fd67b4a0d6a473fe75ceef1=\"Come on darling,\" he says, arm upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Stop it, you know I'm nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see that, and it's damn silly. Once it's done, we'll be made. We can get away, fly anywhere in Foundation.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's left of Foundation, Al. If it's gonna go up, I wanna be here. This is my home, don't you try and take it away from me too!\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have heard that a million times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well it don't get any easier to say.\"\r\n\r\nA series of frank footsteps on the veranda. A burly man from the shadows. \r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady,\" he says, in a voice like midnight shingle, then he looks to Alika and nods.  \r\n\r\n\"Meni,\" says Alika, nodding back. 
codex.71e3c37357f49a5ca5c7cb5ae27e6c41=\"I see you lost yours,\" Menizes chuckles, with a cursory look to where the brass moustache fell. Menizes has one of his own, but it's wooden and engraved with hair-like swirls. He turns to Lois, then brushes her cheek and snarls, \"Don't you mess this up lady. You're in the know, so there's no backing out. If you try anything, we'll find you, and you know what'll happen then.\"\r\n\r\nAlika takes a last hook of his cigar, and then stubs it on the crabshell. \r\n\r\n\"Ok Meni back off, she knows, c'mon take it easy,\"\r\n\r\nAlika herds the two of them out of the brisk mountain air. The music perks up, and the bar is crowded and noisy.\r\n\r\n\"So?\" says Lois. \r\n\r\n\"From the ground,\" grunts Menizes.\r\n\r\n\"What?!\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't expect it. If we go by air, there's a bank of cannons for skyships that come knocking. Look, we can get in via the gate. The godhands take shifts - the changeover's the worst time, 'cause they're alert, so we gotta wait until they're half asleep.\"\r\n\r\nMenizes smiles and looks to Lois, waiting. Both he and Alika know this is all any of them have.\r\n\r\n\"Ok. Ok.\"
codex.8e496090ad95f8fa363c8e153bc73419=The perimeter of the mine is punctuated by hastily-constructed blockhouses, which are cracked and broken down from the quakes. Holes are filled with bits of debris. The crickets chirp, the moons are half-full. Godhands strut rigidly along the wall, stopping at intervals to talk. \r\n\r\n\"Look, up there,\" points Lois. Above the command centre is a grey platform docking freight ships. A trio of Essedari scan the horizon with their binoculars from a control tower nearby.\r\n\r\n\"That's them. Just do what you do, and it'll be fine,\" says Alika. He takes off his long mantle, and reverses it, so that the lining is on the outside. The lining is white, and bears the angel insignia of Sabor. \r\nLois is dressed head-to-toe in black, her belt heavy with gizmos.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think what we are doing will help?\" she says. \r\n\r\n\"Not the time, Lois. Focus on the job.\" \r\n\r\nHe takes his timekeep from his pocket, and then replaces it.\r\n\r\n\"Ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready,\" she says. She unpins her glass moustache, and hands it to Alika, \"if I don't come back, you could use one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very funny. Good luck.\"
codex.9b99b3959504194bf508c7ac99ea2db6=She lopes panther-like to point. She aims for the spot equidistant between two floodlamps, and the godhands don't see her as she takes two long strides, jumps into the fence, and twists over it. Alika swings his goggles up to the control tower. The Essedari are still going about their routines, and he breathes a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nInside the walls there is a general hum of machinery. Signs of occupation. The old Mellifluan buildings are dwarfed by the megastructure that the Saborians have only recently sealed into the rock face. But much of its glass is cracked, and some panes are missing entirely. Mining vehicles chug uniformly in and out of the hangars.\r\nLois cartwheels across the rubble, and scurries in through the squat door of the old lean-to. It used to be the main office of the mine, but it's token now. She hears voices, and quickly backs against the wall.
codex.4956df80fe319870058fd7b2128ef605=\"I'm not sure there's a reason for you to be here anymore, is all.\"\r\n\r\nAn official voice, Saborian. \r\nBlood-red carpets swing from the ceiling, and the shelves are cluttered with copper urns and smoking apparatus. There are paper archives on several large and obstructive bookshelves whose dust show they are now seldom used.  \r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Durius?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well Okropir, preliminary readings show that if we dig beneath this office, we'll come across the biggest seam on the site.\"\r\n\r\nLois gets to the near aisle, and peeks at the two men through sand-coloured filing. The Mellifluan is bearded and diminutive, the Saborian dressed in a stiff white uniform of which Alika's mantle is a copy.\r\n\r\n\"But this is not yours to demolish. Our agreement is supposed to be temporary, all of this is temporary,\" Okropir says.
codex.dffa56e7fd2e7891d6647bf2948d81c2=\"It's been agreed at a higher level. If we win the war, we bring prosperity to Melliflua, and everyone's happy. Look how efficient the mining has been since our arrival - when the war is finished you'll have plenty of Atlas.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's if the war finishes. I've spent my whole life with these rocks, and I'm sick of them. I don't give a fig for Atlas. But this office is my office, and I won't let you touch it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Obstructing us? There are hundreds of mines like this in Melliflua. A one-man rebellion will make no difference to the war.\"\r\n\r\n\"This mine is near three-hundred years old, and I have worked here for forty-four years. You might think you have a tradition, but you don't. Your people have no culture, no history. You're blank as a page.\"\r\n\r\n\"You and your books Okropir. We'll let the Aetherium decide your fate, stubborn little winkle, or perhaps the bulldozer.\"\r\n\r\nThe Saborian turns to leave, but something keeps him there. \r\n\r\n\"Have you heard the stories of limbo?\" says the old Mellifluan, licking his lips, \"The mines. Armadas. War. Soon we will be at the precipice, looking down over Limbo. Limbo is the end, my friend.\" \r\n\r\nDurius scoffs hollowly, and walks away. Lois shadows him around the shelves, until he is gone. \r\n\r\n\"Limbo is coming, I tell you!\" Okropir shouts after him.
codex.ab788a11569c7839456197dea0926304=Before he knows it, Lois has Okropir at the deadly end of her gun. \r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" he sighs.\r\n\r\n\"I need you to open the gate. I promise, it's for a good cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard us talking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, what's this for?\" \r\n\r\n\"It's for Melliflua. Make me a distraction at the gate. I need those Essedari on alert.\"\r\n\r\nOkropir nods, and Lois lowers her gun to her side. He walks slowly past, out of the old mining offices, and calmly across the compound. She watches from the window as he turns the crank, and the main gate begins to open. The godhands get to their feet in disbelief, rushing along the wall to challenge him.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" \r\n\r\n\"I was given an instruction by the commander,\" he lies. The godhands tune into their radios.
codex.86d3ac21ee0dc6d8059c1f36973e8d74=Lois is watching through the glass. Okropir's distraction must be enough to draw the Essedari, she thinks. Craning her neck, Lois can see movement above the command centre, and the yellow beacon flickers. She can hear their gymnothrusters bursting into life.\r\n\r\nShe makes for the rear of the old office, and squeezes out from behind an iron grille. Back to her feet in a bounce, she pounds at full speed across the compound to take cover behind a rusting jig concentrator. She watches the Essedari hover casually towards the commotion at the main gate. It gives her a chance to make a break for the command centre, and the tower above it.\r\n\r\nShe's in through the main door, and quickly concealed behind a line of white pillars stamped with the angel insignia. The floors are marbled, but cracks shock across the floor, and pallets and joists have been laid to make it navigable. She has to make it up there, fast.
codex.3b3178c643bbbfa115f05eb1d52f3b3e=Meanwhile, Alika waits for the right moment. He checks his timekeep. She must be inside by now, he thinks. Menizes nods. Alika stands, straightens his uniform, and makes for the gate where the two Essedari have Okropir in custody. Alika had to shut this place down for good.\n\n\"I'm ahead of a road transit convoy,\" says Alika to the Essedari, whose visors are up. They see his uniform and stand to attention, \"so why are the gates being closed again?\"\nAlika hands over a telegram. \n\nRoad transit convoy approaching. Open main gate.\n\n\"We weren't expecting any delivery today,\" says the taller Essedari.\nAlika points up to their colleague on the tower. \n\"76 replied to say he received the message, and you'd be ready for us, and that someone would open the gates.\"\nThe Essedari buzz up for 76 to come down. He engages his gymnothruster and descends rapidly. As he lands, the dust billows up beneath him. He lifts his visor, revealing a furrowed monobrow. \n\"Apparently you ok'd this message?\" says the taller Essedari.\n\"Not at all. Who are you anyway?\" he says to Alika. But Alika is looking up at the tower again, where Lois had already weighed anchor from the gunships and the stone transports, letting them drift crewless up into the clouds. The Essedari follow his gaze, and realising they have been tricked, unholster their pistols. But Alika already has them where he wants them. He pulls the fuel cord on the nearest gymnothruster, severs it, and diverts the jet into monobrow's face, who chokes and falls. Before the other two Essedari can react, Alika has bashed their heads together and knocked them out cold.
codex.14af29fff0522ddc71207e0aa5ee962d=\"Take this,\" he says to Okropir, tossing him a gun. They are already under heavy fire, but Menizes is a crack shot, and has a vantage point beyond the fence. He picks off the best of them, and leaves the rest at the mercy of Alika and Okropir.\r\n\r\nWhen the last godhand falls, Alika seizes his chance, and signals to Menizes to bring the explosives. Haulage drivers stop, and climb out of their rollers. Good Mellifluan men and women. Alika tells them it's time for them to grab their stuff and leave. \r\n\r\nAlika winches Menizes and the explosives down the open shaft on the ropelift. When Menizes has set the charges, Alika winches him back up. Suddenly an alarm sounds from the main building. Lois emerges from the portcullis with Commander Durius at gunpoint ahead of her. \r\n\r\n\"I couldn't stop the alarm,\" she shouts through the haze of Atlas dust. A second wave of godhands who have heard the alarm have taken up positions around them. Shots are fired, and Menizes does his best to return them.
codex.c9ae5cdf6f899adb7037dfa4c85fe4ff=The rebels take cover behind the lean-to.\r\n\r\n\"You won't get away with this,\" says Commander Durius. \r\n\r\n\"There's three of us, with no back-up. We never expected to,\" replies Menizes.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make me hurt you Menizes!\" yells Lois, \"I won't die here, and nor will you.\"\r\n\r\nAlika hangs his head. For once he sounds sincere.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry Lois.\" \r\n\r\n\"You!\" she says, aiming her gun at him.\r\n\r\n\"Had to be this way, and it had to be you Lois. I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the haulage rollers crash through the gate. Some of the godhands set off in pursuit of the rollers.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry never means anything from you, Alika,\" Lois says with feeling, \"now shut up, and let's get out of here.\" \r\n\r\n\"Well if we try by foot, we might stand a chance. We could hide in the canyon.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have a better idea,\" she says, grabbing Commander Durius in a headlock. If they could get through the command centre, and up to the docking platform, there would still be one gunship waiting. She edges out from behind the lean-to, gun to Durius' head. The godhands cease fire.\r\n\r\nAs they cross the compound, hands twitch on triggers. Then one shot is fired, then two. The godhands know if Durius dies, he will ascend a hero. Shots rip into him and he lets out a final yelp. \r\n\r\n\"Run!\" Lois says, dropping the dead commander. Bullets come thick and fast as they make for the door. But Okropir isn't with them, instead he is running toward the guns.\r\n \r\n\"For Melliflua!\" he cries. Then he staggers, blood runs down his beard, and he drops, dead in the dust.
codex.c4da7f3f75c107cfb24178bab2414d90=Lois weighs anchor, Alika takes the wheel.   \n\nThe mine shrinks below them. When they are at sufficient altitude, Menizes spins the crank on the transmitter. After a moment, there is a violent explosion, and an onion of flame bulges up beneath them. The anthill has been well and truly stirred. \n\nWithin minutes, a fleet of Saborian ships is encircling the blast site.  \n\n\"We're just part of the fleet, fly steady and in formation,\" Lois says. \n\n\"If they find us we're finished,\" says Menizes, his back heavy with sweat. \n\n\"We were finished back at the mines according to you, but here we still are...most of us anyway,\" says Lois, angel of Kubo.\n\nA telegram shoots from the machine, and Menizes collects and reads it. He passes the note silently through the mizzenhole and then lights a cigar. \n\n\"They're not after us,\" yells Menizes into the wind. \n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Read it.\"\n\nAlert. Large Kioki force on approach to Kubo Mine.\n\n\"We'll be stuck in someone else's fight, one we can't win. Not with the flag of Sabor draping from our bows,\" Menizes fumes. Sure enough, along the horizon, dots appear against the clouds. Soon the green hulls of the Kioki are in plain view.\n\n\"Did we cause this?\"\n\n\"Looks like Kioki were after that mine too, and now they think the Saborians are burning their bridges.\" \n\n\"What in Shabo's name is that?\" says Alika. They look back to the west, where more Saborians approach to rendezvous with their patrol. The reinforcements are not ships, but winged ogres.\n\n\"Sky Hulks,\" says Menizes. 
codex.78e03bd958c9d68adec4cf41051d0954=All I knew was that if we went back, they'd make us slaves, and I was slave enough already.\r\n\r\nThe sand scalded my feet. When one foot got too hot, I balanced on the other. I was watching the Coral Dew, and I was trying to stay quiet, but Una followed me, sniffed me out, and wouldn't stop whining. \r\n\r\nAs the sun reached its summit, my brother Azrudin climbed back aboard. He scanned the land around the ship one last time, and I could have sworn his telescope fixed upon us for a moment before moving on. But when the parents came back with their haul, the ship rose up quick and bobbed away. I thought I'd feel relief, but the sun and the scrub made me afraid. My life was nothing now but dunes and crags.
codex.fe727a6b6ccabebb3a23756df40a8ee2=A rocky outcrop promised shade. Umbrella trees emerged from improbable holes in the red stone. Flies fizzed above the gulch between the trees, which like an oasis, drew us in. As we stood over the incline, there was a deep stench, the smell of a dead animal or some such, and my hand came up to my nose. Una seemed impervious to the smell, and her jasmine-white nose muzzled about the shingle, and a crescent of stagnant water.\r\n\r\nI descended the scree-strewn slope to find the entrance to a cave, and as I crossed the threshold, it became immediately cool. Some tracks led deeper down, marks of paws and claws, then petered out. I could have stopped there, but something urged me on. I felt my way ahead, and daylight and blue sky were still visible between the natural bridges of rock above us. I could hear Una padding along behind me all the while. Ahead, the sides came together, and I was forcing myself through narrower gaps. When everything got really dark, I panicked I wouldn't know my way back. 
codex.258d7b9168385a0525fcda285036fd32=At the point of no return, I saw a dim but spectral glow. It was faint and eerie turquoise. With renewed hope, I scuffled on and found the source of light was closer than I thought. I reached for the blob, and it extinguished. There was something soft in my fist. I opened it, and saw a pudgy little worm there. It glowed much fainter, perhaps to play dead. I put it on the ground, and Una sniffed it. When we walked away, it effervesced brightly again. A grotto opened out beyond. There were thousands more of the worms ahead, whole constellations of them. The grotto floor grew pointed teeth like jaws, and the walls oozed sulphur.  \r\n\r\nA subterranean river met us. Una and I walked alongside, watching it twinkle slow and tranquil. Then Una leapt in, and realising how cold it was, leapt out again, shaking off the water. We followed it until it drained away through a hole, which echoed as if the water had a long way to fall. 
codex.a55bec0231aabfd5e732ea687a720391=Then we were in a narrow tunnel, and it was as bright as day. The worms here had balled up together. As we advanced, Una barked, and I had a bad feeling when I saw what kept them packed so tight. Suspended from the ceiling were rows of glass jars. I unhooked one and held it in my hand. The worms inside writhed, illuminating a seductive layer of jelly at its bottom. I returned the jar to its hook, and inspected the ceiling. It was covered in chip marks and scratches, fervent and unique. I reached up and touched the cross-hatchings, pondering. Had someone made these marks? Something?
codex.27efab3b130e5f128ea79fe3b80ffe33=\"Screeeeeeee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\" I said, into the dark.\r\n\r\n\"Screeeeeee!\" \r\n\r\nIt was somewhere off to my left, and getting closer. I thought about ducking under the water, but it was too shallow. Una growled and looked to me for guidance. \r\n\r\n\"Screeeeee!\" it said, stepping into the light.\r\n\r\nBeneath a chandelier of glow-jars to my left was a thing. It was hairless, pink, and scaboid. Perhaps half my height, its oval face was dominated by a huge pair of front teeth. Its red eyelids were sealed shut, and its body was a stooping column of creased and freckled skin. Curved spurs protruded from its feet and hands, and a wispy black garment draped from its breast. \r\n \r\n\"Screeeeee!\" I said, hoping it would understand. It tilted its head quizzically, sniffing at Una, before advancing towards me purposefully. \r\n\r\nI was so transfixed, that I remained completely still until the buck-tooth monster was at my side. It pulled my arm as if to lead me somewhere. Dazed, I followed. Reluctantly, Una came too, protesting my lack of resistance with a snarl.\r\n\r\n\"Screeeee!\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the hand that gripped. The Envoy's skin was translucent. We were led along a passage dotted with jelly lamps until we reached a pleasing and homely burrow. 
codex.8080a40426181f5c77bf35a22688c615=The Envoy stood on his back legs, and with one outstretched paw, presented me with a black tabard like the one it wore. At the centre of the tabard, the material was darker, and shaped like a plait. The Envoy tried to fit one on Una too, but she barked and frightened him away. \r\n\r\nThe Envoy joined its friends, who were huddled on one side of the burrow, while Una and I remained on the other. It was cold, but I couldn't make a fire what with the thought of the smoke, and not knowing if they would tolerate it. I thought the least I could do was don the tabard, at which there was a delighted chattering of teeth. The creatures faced me for a moment, before bundling up again. They were uncommonly ugly. Una and I closed up and tried to sleep.
codex.44abbcfc3f16e1f0a73c1fd31d83cc92=I dreamed of my brother Azrudin, and the Palace of the Old Kings falling into the void. \r\n\r\nI woke abruptly to violent screeching. There was a nauseating smell. I was freezing, there was no light at all, and I couldn't feel Una. \r\n\r\n\"Screeeeee!\"\r\n\"Nehhhhhhhh,\"\r\n\"Screeeeee!\"\r\n\"Nehhhhhhhh.\"\r\n\r\nI scrabbled to my feet, and followed the screeching. It seemed to grow further away at first, and then louder. Then I saw a pale light and followed it. It turned out to be an abandoned jar, glass cracked, and its worm wriggling away. I picked up the worm and held it up between my fingers, so that I could see the outline of the passage ahead. As I walked, a chilling wind blew back my hair. The screeching grew louder, and was joined by a swishing sound.  \r\n\r\nFinally, round a corner, a great cavern opened up the size of a city. A fingernail of moonlight flood in from above, bathing a battlefield in blue, where thousands of the ratfolk clashed. There were the black tabards of the Envoy's faction, but at their throats, others who wore silver crowns cast in the shape of the plait. They swung thick thorny branches ferociously at each other - that swishing sound. Then I saw Una, who was wearing one of the black tabards, gnawing the leg of a silver hat while he flogged her with a thorny cudgel.
codex.f5f7392e7cae1801c919b8579bb5470f=\"Stop it!\" I yelled, jumping down to the cavern floor and rushing towards her. My size and strangeness seemed to cause panic among nearby silver hats, and many dropped their thorn branches. \r\n\"Wooooooo,\" came a lamenting cry which rippled over their kin. My arrival, clad in the Envoy's colours, had seemed to swing the battle in the tabard's favour. The silver hats beat a hasty retreat, each scuttling to the nearest escape. Within moments the field was empty but for the victors. \r\nThe black tabards roared and shook their thorn branches in triumph, then took turns to urinate upon the dust. Then they held Una aloft, and she wagged her tail. We trooped back to the burrow to celebrate.\r\n\r\nFrankly I didn't know what to think of the night's events, but one thing was certain, Una had quickly become as much a black tabard as any of the ratfolk. They petted and stroked her, and Una was happy to join their acrid-smelling huddle. Without the black tabards, the poor girl would probably have gone hungry. I was offered some worms, but declined. Only if I absolutely have to, I thought. The tabards were noticeably more guarded toward me than they had been, which I presumed to be a form of reverence. Or was it that for some reason, just like Una, they were disappointed in me.
codex.80f1501451eb64f6015970377919e0fd=Several days after the battle, I had given up on trying to get the tabards, or Una, to find me a way out of the caves, and in hunger had been forced to eat a worm. It tasted ok. These invertebrates were so important to the ratfolk, that I was convinced it must be what they were fighting over. Then there was the cold, and the constant darkness.\r\nAll things considered, I didn't want to spend the remainder of my life underground, and without Una to comfort me, regretted the moment I first stepped into the cave.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to dwell on the gloominess of it all, I took a handful of worms, and navigated my way back to the battlefield where I'd seen the moonlight streaming in. I looked longingly up at the oval of blue sky, wondering if the walls could be scaled. They couldn't. After some fruitless wanderings in the caves beyond, I trudged, exhausted, back to the burrow. \r\n\r\nThe burrow was deserted. I pottered on through ante-chambers, low-ceilinged vaults filled with glow jars and earthen pots, seeing no-one. Finally, at the far side, I came upon a room with a furnace, and a chimney leading up to the surface. At least if I were stuck here, I'd have somewhere to keep warm, I thought. The furnace was part of a machine that manufactured all of the little jars to hold the worms. One of the tabards was next to it, sifting sand between her paws into a silver funnel. 
codex.e464187d312b22986f4cc4e834ec46e3=I heard a bark, and found Una and some of the tabards in the room beyond. They were digging a watery pit for worms. I tried to help out, but my blunt fingernails were poorly-suited to the task. We struck a layer of yellow clay, and tired of digging, I began to model it in my fingers. It turned into an old-fashioned boat, but the sails I made were too heavy and drooped off their masts. \r\n\r\nThen I made a plait shape, just like the ones on the tabards. I lifted it up to the glow-worm lamp to admire my efforts. All of a sudden, I became aware of an expectant silence, the scrabbling had stopped, and the tabards were gathered around me, noses twitching. In spite of their poor eyesight, they must have been able to see the silhouette of the clay against the light, and were admiring it. \r\n\r\n\"Screeeeee!\" the envoy cried. 
codex.25206fef923cafb67b0d1fe08ea23d7e=Just as before, the Envoy led me by the arm. But the path was unfamiliar, and I felt us rapidly climbing. Eventually we reached a large burrow, or so I first thought. But overhead were the stars and a piece of the moon! Oh the relief I felt in that moment, and I took in a fresh gulp of air. I followed the Envoy to something spiny, like a mansize nut husk. I touched it, it was metallic. I climbed through the small door, and the Envoy started the engine.\r\n\r\nWe bumbled towards a light on the horizon, and black specks became the hulls of waiting skyships. \r\n\r\n\"Screee!\" said the Envoy.\r\n\r\nI could see it now, the Lighter of the Lamps. A crowd of tourists milled about its base, looking up, and taking photographs. The nearer we got, the better I could see the plait-like stone extending to the heavens, and brighter was the gleam of its colony. Despite their number, each of the worms sang alone and apart. 
codex.6f68399616c1bf65d44351ddc041cf32=\"Screee,\" I said, appreciatively. The Envoy nodded slightly, landed the ship, and ushered me out.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" I said, but he was already back in the air. I trundled to where the frillships gathered.  \r\n\r\n\"Oh hello,\" said a smartly-dressed man in Ishgiruan, \"got lost did you? Ship's leaving, we have to get on home now. We aren't stopping at Kubo, the war's seen to that.\" \r\n\r\n\"Oh right,\" I said, \"yes...\"\r\n\r\nI followed him to the frillship, and climbed aboard. How many other chances would I get? The engines fired, and the Atlas glowed. I was excited to hear human conversation again, being somewhere I half-belonged. The ship was up, and the Lighter of the Lamps shrank beneath us. As we circled it, I could not shake the thought of our little dog. I cried and cried for Una, as never before.

This is my last chance to find Una, my brother.\n\nFor the life of me I cannot find the entrance to the burrow, and even if I did, I don't know if I'd have the courage to go in. We search for her in vain. \n\nI cling onto faint hopes. The hope my brother somehow found her, or that Una found my brother, and as the ground crumbles, they take comfort in one another. But Azrudin is out there still, I am sure of it.\n\nI will see them all in the kingdom that follows the clouds, where the Palace of the Old Kings reigns, and the three shining popels are restored. For in the afterlife, they are symbols of which all Bandinians can be proud.

Nikol is a Chabuti tailor, and Troio is a Mellifluan textile merchant and acquaintance. \n\nNikol: \"It is your move.\"\n\nTroio sets down his vittles unhurriedly, takes up the becat dice, and gripping them tightly, shakes for an unnecessarily long time.\n\nNikol: (Gruffly) \"For pity, this vittles is not a Chabuti blend. (He throws the remainder onto the ground) My friend, it is your move.\"\n\nTroio is still shaking the dice, smiling as if transfixed.\n\nNikol: \"Are you mad Melly? It is your turn with the dice!\"\n\nTroio snaps out of it. He stops shaking the dice. \n\nTroio: (still smiling) \"Don't you Melly me! It is you who have the lady-drobe, Cha-boot.\"\n\nNikol: \"Don't you Cha-boot me! That gown is not for me, it is a gift for my wife, the thought of which you have now ruined! I am fully a man, solely a man! I have none of your Mellifluan whimsy in my veins.\"\n\nTroio: \"And I, no Chabuti prejudice and cantankery in mine! What is so strange about manly women, womanly men, or whatever lies between?\"\n\nNikol: \"I have nothing against the differences between people Troio! I simply wish to clarify that I myself am no more or less than a man.\"

Troio seems to have noticed them, and is looking about uncertainly. Nikol continues his rantings, oblivious.\n\nTroio: \"Nikol perhaps now is not the occasion-\"\n\nNikol: \"You are the one who keeps remarking upon my appearance and preferences, yet it is you who claim I am judgmental. Well here is my judgment - I pronounce Chabuti and Melliflua enemies for all eternity...that is until the day a Chabuti man in women's clothes kisses a Mellifluan woman in a man's clothes, on the highest peak of the Korchis mountains, and with you Troio, present as witness.\"

Come here.\"\n\nParsimonia manhandles her daughter, and forces her into the starting position of the routine. \n\n\"Hum de-dum, hum-de dum. Like that. Come on, it couldn't be easier. Now you try.\"\n\nAlonia mis-steps the routine.  \n\nParsimonia: \"No, no. Again.\"\n\nAlonia: \"I hate these stiff Chabuti dances mother, do I really have to do it?\"\n\nParsimonia: \"Of course dear, this is a serious affair. We have a job to do, unless of course, you want the war to drag on, and all those delicious young men to stay on the front lines?\"\n\nAlonia: \"Of course I want the war to end, but I don't see how a young woman doing this rigid dance is going to help. Isn't it more of a manly dance?\"\n\nParsimonia: \"You'll dance as you're told. Besides, it must be a girl, and they must be 'young', because (mimics voice of authority) 'that is how the Chabuti have always done it'.\"\n\nParsimonia crosses her arms, and looks sulkily at her feet.\n\n\"Yes, it seems that talent has no bearing on the selection process.\"\n\nParsimonia breathes deeply, then proceeds to execute the entire routine exactly. When she has finished she smiles at Alonia confrontationally.\n\nAlonia: \"So you won't mind if I don't dance well?\"\n\nParsimonia: \"Dear daughter, for you, it is not about dancing well, it is about dancing tolerably. Now get back to your mark.\"

He talks to an urchin-like personage, known to others as Stoop, who carries a hundred garments of myriad colours under his arm. \n\nStoop: \"Did you like the yellow one? I liked it, but it's no beetle-red. It tapers nicely at the collar, and there's lots of room for your neck, I know how much you hate it being close on the neck.\"\n\nElagabas: \"Thank you Stoop, I'm sure it'll be fine.\"\n\nStoop: \"I'm not sure about the plum boothose. They weren't as shapely as the cobbler led me to believe...do you think-\"\n\nElagabas: (mildly irritated) \"-Hush Stoop, we approach the house of my love. There's no time for talk of bobby socks.\"\n\nStoop: \"Taking care of your dress pleases young ladies.\"\n\nElagabas: \"Hush!\"\n\nStoop is crestfallen. They are at the house of Parsimonia and Alonia. Parsimonia is hanging out the washing, looking approvingly at Elagabas. Alonia however, disappears inside the moment he arrives.\n\n\"Alonia? Alonia!?\"\n\nParsimonia: \"Well hello young man, how nice of you to visit me.\"\n\nStoop: \"Actually, the master's here to see your daughter,\"\n\nElagabas: (sycophantically, whilst trying to catch a glimpse of Alonia) \"Well, in the main, though she is not as forthcoming as her mother.\" \n\nParsimonia: \"She lacks experience. She is young and silly, and has no interest beyond staring gormlessly up at the stars-\"\n\nElagabas: \"-and drinking milk. (Raising his voice so there is no doubt that Alonia can hear) You see I bought some goat's milk, because I know how she likes it...\"

In the centre, serious-looking faces crowd the becat table, where Troio is about to roll the dice. Nikol is also there. The Burgher appears from offstage.\n  \nBurgher: \"Stop! Stop! There is to be no gaming, by order of the principality of Melliflua. That involves Chabuti contestants.\"\n\nThere is booing from both the Chabuti and Mellifluans. Troio puts down his dice, and stands on the table.\n\nTroio: \"The people of the Korchis mountains have played becat here for generations. Chabuti or Mellifluan, man, woman, any gender. It is our right to play.\"\n\nThere is affirmative grunting from all present. Enter Stoop and Elagabas. \n\nBurgher: \"Haven't you noticed there's a war on?\"\n\nTroio: \"Then we await the call, and until then reserve the right to play our games!\"\n\nThere is grunting of approval from all present.\n\nBurgher: \"Well that's just it. I'm here to tell you that the draft has begun. Whomsoever here that is Mellifluan will be assigned a ship, and sent to the border, where you shall meet the Cha-boots in the skies and decide the fate of the continent of Shabo in our favour.\"\n\nThere is murmuring. After a pause, the Chabuti players and spectators vacate their chairs, and head off towards the border.     \n\n\"That's it, go home and cry to your mothers!\"

Perhaps hearing that I go to war will melt her heart.\"\n\nHe rushes from the stage, and Stoop follows as quick as he can behind. Meanwhile Troio rounds upon Nikol, who despite being a Chabuti, remains.\n\nTroio: You've cursed us with your incendiarism, this is your doing!\n\nNikol: I see now I was wrong, forgive me Troio. Is there anything we can do to reverse this sickness?\n\nTroio: I see no answer but one. You must dress up as a woman, and find a Mellifluan woman who will dress as a man. Then, you must find two pairs of boots fit to trek up to the highest peak of the Korchis, and find love enough in your hearts to kiss.\n\nExeunt. Act 2.\n
codex.531abfa737ea4b8b23e980a9ed45d8ab=Report. 4th Kif, 3039.\n\nIf we return to Sabor, I hope to file this public record. Everything I state here is true to the best of my recollection, and I withhold nothing. \nFreedom. Equality. We are god.\n\nAt very short notice, some two weeks ago, I was reassigned to the Stalk. To what purpose I could not fathom, since I am expert in ship-to-ship communication, not politics.\n\nI vowed to make the best of it, and was surprised to find that morning, a large number of similarly baffled new recruits were gathered in the lobby. We speculated as to why the sun hadn't come out for months.
codex.9cda189b1afbd9051cdaa1244cd71a33=A very brief and jittery address was given by a former colleague of mine, Captain Mirro. He told us something utterly unexpected. He said the Stalk was a flying machine, much like a skyship, and that we were going to be crewing it into battle. He seemed unsure how this would be possible until Admiral Methusan arrived. \r\n\r\nMethusan was, by contrast, cocksure. He took us up to the separation point at the 24th floor, and revealed a hidden panel behind a portrait of Utopian Zubin. He solved a combination, and a door opened to a windowed gallery full of antiquated looking controls and devices, where a Pilipus was already busy brushing the cobwebs away.\r\n\r\n\"This will be your new ship,\" Methusan said, \"time to show we lead from the top.\"
codex.1bc2c24912c871a8b0829544805ef473=We all wanted to impress, but were doubtful whether a ship that was two-hundred and fifty years old, and had never been used, could even get off the ground.\r\n\r\nThe civilians were evacuated, and as rumour spread, we could see crowds milling about below, looking up at the Stalk in wonder. \r\n\r\n\"Commence separation,\" said Methusan, and to our surprise, the great umbrella lifted up, and purred to altitude. It seemed skyworthy. The engines were at least as good as the Gallish ones. How had such knowledge been allowed to gather dust, all these years?\r\n\r\nHowever stable the Stalk was in flight, there were murmurings. This was the very core of our identity, uprooted. It felt desperate. Final.
codex.4bc0970b492b7b5487e249a5943d19c0=As we neared the rendezvous south-west of Vinicoti, the senior officers, myself included, were called to a meeting. I was astonished to discover the entire Stalk Committee had travelled with us. At its head, the man they said had risen, Premier Telemon. Their expressions were grave, except for Methusan, who was as cheerily confident as on the previous day.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome,\" Methusan said, \"Today is important. It is the day we rally our troops and make the final push. Can you imagine how our fleet will react when they see the Stalk appear behind them in battle? Can you imagine the fear of the enemy upon seeing a ship so large and well-equipped as this?\"
codex.48c129c97db492f576f1d0acaefa49e3=Premier Telemon could see from our faces that other questions needed answering before the Committee could count on our loyalty. He gently moved Methusan aside.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Admiral,\" he said. His face was plump and his eyes sunken. Not at all like the photographs. He had a shocking clump of white hair at either temple, and a shamefully portly frame.\r\n\r\n\"Many of you will believe that I, Telemon Aristei, who now enters his seventy-third year, should long since have risen. You, or someone you know, will have held a placard calling for me to be stripped of citizenry. I accept your challenge, I do. But knowledge has become a problematic thing for us Saborians. Someone has needed to carry the torch, to pass our essence on to the next generation. It was agreed by unanimous vote that person should be me.\"\r\n\r\nHis words tamed us, and before long we were taking instructions the way all good Saborians do.
codex.f13827df73d1e7b8d5dbb048ffc2ae01=I buried my nails into my chair. I knew from the maps that below us, as far as the eye could see should have been the continent of Shabo, with the peaks of the Korchis mountains on the horizon. \r\n \r\nWhat we saw instead was terrifying. A dark fabric, slit as if with a scalpel to form a vast elliptical cut. The ocean gathered at the crater's cliff-like fronds, cataracts shimmering down into the abyss. \r\nSomeone opened the outer door, and the bridge filled with the deafening sound of water. We became hysterical. Someone shut the door, and a Pilipus passed around salts to keep us level.  \r\n\r\nI could not bring myself to look any longer. Nausea see-sawed me. I fell and clutched the cabin floor. My vision blurred, and I inhaled the dusty carpet, pretending what I'd seen was a dream. \r\n\r\nTelemon and his Committee remained in their offices, among papers and strategies, unwilling to face the spectacle our rape of Melliflua's resources had caused. But Overseer Bulgus remained on the bridge with us. \r\n\r\nSuch a hard man, Bulgus, such a patriot. But as he stood at the observation window, all he could say was, \"I'll never see Melliflua.\" \r\nThen he sat down, and wept until his eyes were raw.
codex.076ea8859f683694bfdbe9f911b8fee2=Methusan buzzed about as if nothing had changed, but the rest of us already felt beaten. The crew were listless, lost in thought. I knew they prayed to Aetherium for the families lost to the deep, mostly Mellifluan, but Saborian too. \r\n\r\nThen the fighting began in earnest. Few of us had seen action at the front, and those who had, said it was never like this. \r\nA whole Kioki ship immolated. A burning man running across deck, flinging himself overboard so it could all be over. \r\nThe Kioki force was ragged, but thick. Thousands and thousands of vessels, none built the same as the last, each the servant of the monied of Ten-Rui. The smell of powder filled the air. \r\n\r\nTo the right flank, directly above the skirt of the abyss, our Essedari thrust their way toward a Kioki Heavy Freighter belonging to a Lark brigade. But several other Lark ships came running and closed ranks.\r\n\r\nWe turned our cannons upon the Sky Hulks, which drudged the cloudy expanse like the monstrosities that they were.
codex.6c71aa734535134814f83bc7f3c00164=Great howitzing smokecracks could not be heard against the swirling drain of the ocean, as the bloats of Sky Hulks collided, their visors reflecting the hazy light. \r\nThen as night drew, the battle proper began. Something about the recklessness of both sides told us this was the big one. Rumour spread from one of the Essedari ships that the Empress herself was aboard the Kioki flagship. \r\n\r\nHer fleet ploughed towards us demented, deranged. We fought them off bravely for a time, but there were just too many, too fast.
codex.27971163512aba554eed92a2d1bb665a=We were under heavy fire. I cannot say quite what happened next. There was a drop in pressure, and the pristine white dome above us sheared. The wind whistled through, blowing papers and everything else overboard. Then the aft propellers cut and we lurched. The upper disc slid off and over us like a fried egg on a pan. \r\nIt fell - the committee chamber, the assembly chamber - silently into the deep. I could have sworn I saw Telemon pressed against the glass, looking beyond us to Aetherium. Perhaps in that moment he knew, not ascending but descending, what it felt like to be betrayed.    \r\n\r\nThat is the last I recall. \r\nWait, no, there's a moment more, just before freefall. A cord twisting about our ship. Then I pass out.
codex.0a4e9368ba1ba25d8bc5b874c6a69726=The sky is a celestial awning of debris. Flickering fires and malfunctioning lights. For now, Atlas suspends it all up there, like a constellation. This little island is dark, but we keep the lanterns lit, and we listen to the water.   \r\n\r\nThe enemy is here, and they have agreed a ceasefire. When I first awoke after the crash, I had a bad gash in my thigh. A Kioki woman saved me, she was from Pin I think. She did what she could, then moved on to the next casualty.\r\n\r\nOnce I could stand, I was reconciled with my own kind. There were two dozen of us remaining, a tiny band. Methusan and Bulgus were among them.  \r\n\r\nMethusan took up with a couple of Essedari. He wanted to kill the enemy he said, but Bulgus wouldn't allow it. \r\n\r\n\"Don't go Admiral, or I'll have to stop you,\" Bulgus said. \r\n\r\n\"I am the Admiral, and we are at war,\" Methusan replied.\r\n\r\nSo Bulgus put a hole in Methusan. Then the Essedari put a hole in him. \r\n\r\n\"We are God,\" he said as he died, and we put up pilae for them both, and sent them to Aetherium.
codex.d332fcd88ba012a26a7b3a62285f3631=I tried to sell the old town house, but despite it being a stone's throw from the palace, and a jolly old whistle away from the Waterguji market, it was in such a state of disrepair that we received no offers. \r\n\r\n\"It's a bad time,\" my son said, his cheeks sagging heavy with his years. \r\n\"You can say that again,\" I said, \"you're my oldest, keep the house for yourself.\"\r\n\"Goodbye, dad.\" He embraces me. \"Good luck.\" \r\n\r\nThe cart rattles out of Darat. I can't see the dust from the wheels for the dust in the air. My lockbox judders against my thigh, and Mo, my donkey, groans hoarsely. Outside the crumbling wall, urchins wash the family clothes in the stinking river. Alongside them, the penitents wade, the skirts of their bright robes steeped in filth.\r\n\r\nWe call it \"Yellow Blood River\", yellow because of the dust and effluent. Before it was simply \"Blood River\", where the Saborian army washed their swords after the massacre. Twenty-four centuries later, some of us still think we owe Sabor an apology for starting that war, and that our forefathers deserved to be slain. Its an apology the Yellow Blood Penitents are resolved to uphold; between sips of river water they mutter invocations, asking Sabor for forgiveness. As long as they remain, our children are lowered in the bucket to the well of shame.
codex.0490d2226c9a3e494f19bd8ca84c839a=Mo trudges on, and the air clears as the road winds up towards the chalk valley, where the hundred-thousand fell. At night, I've heard that phantoms drift gaily among the buried, talking happily as if they had never been slain. They speak a language few of us, their progeny, can follow.  \r\nThe soldiers' old belongings are still trapped in the earth, though I pray they are never disturbed. They are cursed, and it is said if those treasures are displaced, a terrible sandstorm will descend from the mountains upon Darat, and the city will be consumed.
codex.f0de63999cf0dac777c53fe623792548=Luckily, I do have some money for the journey. I cadged a fistful of Darat coins from a passing Verduban. \"I am poor, I am weak. Give me relief!\" I said, dropping to my knees. \r\nYou can always trust a Verduban for a sponge. They aren't too bright, and they'll do anything for anyone, as long as it makes them feel worthy. It'd be harder to convince a cow it needed milking, than cheat a Verduban of his coins.\r\n\r\nI've taught my children everything I know. I have forty-three, and each knows every twist of Darat's streets. They'll snare a traveller, and lead them back to mama's house for dinner. Dinner leads to a bed for the night, and that means currency! I forget who all their mammas are, and where they live, but I'd never have shacked up with 'em if they couldn't cook and make a bed. And I wonder why no woman cares for me in my dotage! \r\n\r\nMy boys and girls are too busy to look after their old dad too. I don't see a single coin of their takings, and I don't begrudge 'em. I've always said, look after yourself first. \r\n\r\nAll I've really got is Mo, he's a good lad, does what he's told.
codex.18b08d013a1915b7a2c7e37c5cd52986=Mo and I wend through the red gleam of quartz. The haze of the Studded Desert reeks of rat piss. Deserted fortresses rise and fall, where fools tried to make this feeble corner of Foundation theirs. I can't imagine it was an easy place to live, having just enough water myself for the journey across it. There are no oases or underground lakes here. \r\nBut there are still those that choose to live this life, and struggle on. A wastrel girl sits beside the road. She looks dazed. Her caravan is beyond, where her posse turn meat dolefully over a fire, and a couple of grease-monkeys tinker with a buckled propeller. Some have always been Pilipai, others are Sabor's former citizens, stripped of their status. Their lives are hard, their ships ragged and barely skyworthy, but their national pride is unflinching.\r\n\r\n\"Stone,\" the girl croaks between her blistered lips. She holds out a palmful of quartz. She looks at me. Her look says she has pried these stones from the earth with her bare hands. I admire her strength, so I give her a coin. She looks at it, and seeing the head of Orthosa, she tosses it violently back at me.\r\n\"Get away! Alkabar's slime! We are gods,\" she spits, and I swear she is possessed by a sand devil. She rejoins her circle of vultures, who give me malevolent looks. Mo and I quickly move on.
codex.32c90aaaa9440841f26b37e3120a33e2=The cartwheel's snapped and I don't have a spare. So I saddle Mo up, and ride him as far as Conos. I am officially in Saborian territory now, and get the usual warm welcome; provincial Godhands grappling me, hoping to frisk a bit of Atlas. Disappointed I have none, they stamp me roughly with the mark - as if my heritage weren't already obvious. \r\n\r\nThe Godhand pretends not to understand me at first, even though my Saborian is better than his.\r\n\"What?\" he says, playing deaf and laughing to his comrade who smiles, but I know doesn't find it half as funny. \r\nI give them the answer I think they want to hear; \r\n\"I am crossing the border to peddle my wares to your farmers, so that they may better live and farm, and if worthy, become citizens.\"\r\n\"What?\" he says again, and this time I don't reply. He pokes me in the chest.\r\n\"I asked you a question, so you better answer.\"    \r\n\"I am crossing the border to peddle my wares to your farmers, so that they may better live and farm, and if worthy, become citizens,\" I say slowly and clearly. Then he just lets me through because I'm no fun.\r\n\r\nI see the slicing platforms of the residential habitats up overhead, the spidery climb of bright flowers and the gleam of bulbous pears on the arms of its fruit trees. The gilded elevators zooshing down from Conos city to the ground, where the dusty slum-shacks smatter. Conos was built on ancient Cherno, the city Bandinia destroyed. It was a long time ago, but they've never let us forget.
codex.a1a83b0f73256f0bace1ad7c86b230da=It is a moon or two later. We're atop the Mount of Plenty, walking around the lake. The waters are so broad, I can't see the other side, and I feel calmed. This is the source of the river Redu, on which Redusa relies. I let Mo drink, soft and sloppy, then we eat, rest, and I refill the decanter. \r\nThere's folds of travertine on the water's near side, which have naturally formed a tiered garden of ponds. Their low walls are bright green from Atlas. It's easy to catch a few fish, and cook, and I find the roof of a mausoleum part-submerged. Once-holy text babbles along the wall, and continues out of sight beneath the tide of travertine.\r\nFrom where we stand and onwards out to the floodplain beyond, right up to where the river bursts into the delta, the desert dies, and all is lush and verdant green. Redusa is but a silver spectre on the horizon. This is now as far as I have ever been, but I've still a long way left to go.
codex.fcb1ff38131bf623acdbb7f7e4230541=The river's broad and split. Mo's hooves slosh over the orange clay path. I see a rising place overhead. A ship is moored there, and a ritual's a-go. \r\n\r\nA strange thing, the Saborian way, I can't recommend it. We should enjoy life as long as we can, who can know, or have proof there is anything beyond it? Yet they are so convinced, they take off to the grave early. If I were Saborian I'd be long gone, since I am old. But by small and token joys, I am more content and happy now than I have ever been. My journey will end when it ends, not when others decree it must.\r\n\r\nI tether Mo at the base of the beehive, and eavesdrop upon the gathered crowd. A man, ten summers greener than I, is readying himself for the rising place.
codex.15d271b371939daa136c45fb233286a0=\"It is time, father,\" consoles his daughter.\r\n\"Goodbye love. You know I will watch over you from the aether.\"\r\n\"Yes, guide me from Aetherium. Help me follow the tenets and learn from you. Goodbye father.\"\r\nHe steps toward the portal to depart, but it stares back at him cruelly. There is so much he has left unfinished. He turns back to his daughter.\r\n\"And my personal artefacts?\"\r\n\"The assembly have already earmarked them.\"\r\n\"I see,\" he says solemnly, and prepares to advance. But again he falters.\r\n\"Tell your mother I will miss her.\"\r\n\"I don't see her anymore. Besides, you know I cannot.\"\r\nThe man is hysterical, \"Find her and tell her! Tell her I love her now just as much as I did then. Please, for me,\" he pleads.\r\n\"It is not what is done. You know I cannot.\"\r\n\"Then I must tell her myself, or bear eternal regret,\" he says madly, making towards the door, where Mo and I stand. \r\n\"No father!\" says the girl gruffly, taking hold of his shoulders. She is much stronger than him, and after a struggle pushes him into the rising place, where he is gone in a flash. As the other witnesses console the daughter at the apparent indignity, Mo and I leave. \r\nI can't understand it. The last thing I'd want to see before I die is one of my old wives! But they say they'll do anything at that final moment to avoid going through with it.
codex.47c5ae9203c045e6e1668fba6a049e1a=On the approach to the city of Redusa, bevvies of boviaries are nursed by the sacred Redu, whose waters run milky-clear. The farmers here seem happy enough, if aloof. There is a thick smell of manure, and on the road, the horned creatures crowd Mo, in awe of his dankness. They look at his face, and they wonder, \"are you...are we?\"\r\nBut Mo shifts around uneasily. The gaze of the milk-making beasts is too intense for him by a margin. \r\n\r\nWe trundle on to the residences stretching outwards from the city wall. They're all citizens here, because the border of Redusa grows outwards as well as upwards. A man on the back of a donkey will turn heads, revealing sour, suspicious faces. \r\nIf I'm to get out, I might have to leave Mo behind, or trade him. If I have something to sell, I can stowaway in a ship from the small skyport outside the walls. I won't get into the main one, not without going through the Godhands. 
codex.903ce946d300d2b74a10769ae4c80fe0=Well in the end, I find a better way. I approach a small Mellifluan vessel. Mellifluans are good people, if strange. Their faces were painted shades of green and orange. I offer my services as a courier and experienced skyfarer, in exchange for safe passage to Verduba. They aren't interested, but think Mo might be useful. A real live donkey would be a \"riot\" on stage, they say. I take it to mean they want a performance or two from him, once we land in Verduba. I agree to their terms on Mo's behalf, and we set off.\r\n\r\nMo had a hoofy bout of stage fright in the first rehearsal, but seems to have recovered his composure. Rehearsals were of an obscure Mellifluan drama named \"Rethinga,\" it concerns the eponymous queen who wishes to marry a donkey, because he is humbler, more gentle and more polite than her legion of suitors. The play had only managed one showing in Redusa since the Saborians thought it implausible she would not simply have chosen the most handsome suitor over a mule.\r\n\r\nThe spirited young man playing Queen Rethinga is dressed in bright streaming silks. Overhearing their discussions, it seems he is selected on account of his better knowledge of the play, though there are plenty of women in the troupe. This baffled me at first, but by the third airing I was convinced he was the right choice. \r\n\r\nAs for the actresses, there is a beautiful young lady playing the wise old counsel. She is not familiar with the play, but knows how to play bigoted old men perfectly well - which makes sense, given that she grew up with a Chabuti uncle. I too, offer myself up as a character study, which amuses her.
codex.9d9bc11585d6d11f5965f733fcb32c5b=The evening of the play, we land in Verduba. A nithering wind greets us, which they say is the Ice God's work. It is necessary for me to borrow several cloaks. What is all the more astonishing then, as I look out to the theatre audience from the wings, is that many of the Verdubans are entirely naked. \r\n\"When we are nervous, we are told to imagine the audience has nothing on,\" said one actress, \"but here that doesn't work. In Verduba it is hard to know who is performing for who!\" \r\n\r\nMo does his duty with charm, and when I discuss his inclusion with some Verdubans at the bar afterward, they are thrilled at the way the play challenges so many preconceptions. Someone even suggested forming a society against the mistreatment of either sex. Then someone else remarked that such a group already existed. \r\n\r\nWatching the play and talking with these conscientious theatre-goers, I was forced to confront myself. Could I have treated people better? Certainly, but I had no regrets, not when I knew no different. If I could just accomplish what mother had asked of me, it might begin to repair some of the damage I had done to the lives of women I've known.\r\n\r\nWe decide to stay with the theatre troupe until their return to Melliflua, and I take up some odd jobs moving props and prompting the actors with their lines. They are all very impressed with my command of Mellifluan, but it's easy, when you've spent your life in the maze of Darat. I can speak every language well but my own, and there's not a Bandini alive who can speak perfect Bandini.
codex.39db1b6229276bfb5a8bc742999e9b90=We're in Fasio's fishing town, Mo and I. We had a long few weeks in Mellifluan country. Mo caught a splinter in the foot, and refused to budge. While he was recovering, I fell into the arms of a local girl. She would have been a beauty once, and most generous to an old sot. She asked me to marry her, but instead of saying yes, I said I was leaving, like I always do. Before you accuse, remember I make this undertaking for my mother, and must set everything else aside.\r\n\r\nI told this beauty I would never have a second chance. I told her I was headed for the Night Lands on account of my mother. She listened to what I had to say, then she left me. I later read in the press that she was proposed to another, but being well-versed in the language of love, I felt no pinch from it.\r\n\r\nHis ears are full of holes, and they itch because of the flies. But he is happy now we have reached Fasio, and the water of the bay laps his stumpy legs. \r\nHis rejuvenation gets the better of him, and he treads on a sailor's foot. As the owner, I am reprimanded, and having lately been at the tavern, protest a little too fiercely. There is a brawl, and I come out better off than my opponent, a man with a scar on his face. I haven't time to celebrate when I am whacked on the head, and out go the lights.
codex.f3de37e7348f978c0ab7494ca82c01bb=I sup the mug of nut-vittles I have been given. It is hot and by no means unpleasant. I can tell I am being buttered up for something.\r\nThe man behind the desk is asleep. He wears the pauldrons of authority, but snores with impropriety. He wears one of those ridiculous false moustaches that are the fashion in these parts. Why not make the effort and cultivate a real one? I make towards the door to leave, and he jerks to attention. It seems he is one of the Burghers elected to govern this land.\r\n\r\n\"Oi,\" he says, and I jump.\r\n\"Thank you for looking after my donkey..\" I say, seeing Mo through the window. He is standing impassively in the Burgher's stalls.\r\n\"..but it is time I was getting along.\" \r\n\"Nonsense. By Chabuti law, you are obligated to serve a notice of penalty.\"\r\n\"What's that you say?\"\r\nHe looks out of the window at my donkey.\r\n\"Are you alone?\"\r\n\"Just me and Mo.\" \r\n\"Good, and do you fear death?\"\r\n\"I have important business in the Night Lands before my time can come. When I've done that I'll die happy.\"\r\nThe Burgher cocks a gun and checks the barrel. He holds it like a babby in his lap.\r\n\"No, I make no guarantee of that,\" he says, then he stands up and straightens his jacket of office, \"but being a non-Chabuti, and, it seems to me, a man of honour, concerned only for the welfare of his animal, upholding no deplorable and traitorous views about the regency of these lands, I feel you might be apt for a task.\"\r\n\"A task?\"\r\n\"Call it payback for your mule injuring my brother.\"
codex.432ba007fc323df2b807f4e86ac3287a=\"Your brother?\" I say, realising my ill fortune. Among Chabuti, a returned favour must always do more than balance the books.\r\n\r\nIt turns out he wants me to spy on the king. Not a king in title, but in spirit; the pirate king. Naturally, I have no intention of doing it.\r\n\"Yes I'll do it,\" I say, with as much enthusiasm as I could muster.\r\n\"The mission will be a dangerous one, but I give you my word I shall personally attend your matter in the Night Lands, should you yourself not survive,\" he says, the gun careening about in his hand. Then unexpectedly, he passes it over the desk to me. \r\n\"Take it. The target's men are well-armed, and you may need it.\"\r\n\r\nI'm led outside and asked to wait for crewing, but as soon as the Burgher leaves the white daub courtyard, I make a run for the ship so as to commandeer it. I fire a few shots at random with my new gun, keeping the gendarmes at a distance. I manage to get the engines running, and steer the thing afloat unchallenged. The buoys of the skylane bob and swim as I clatter through them. 
codex.7775e0fe9fdd4fecebe5564ed7e4ebc9=As this is my last flight, I detour the ship over the Pintins. Tito Bipo is the highest peak in Foundation. Encircling it, breathing in the cool clear air, I trap the joy of life and the exhale of death in my lungs. Vicariously I'd had the same feeling in Redusa, watching that man \"ascend\". \r\n\r\nWhen I am ready, I land in the Night Lands and absorb the dark grey silence. My feet impress upon the mud, and I looked for a suitable spot to carry out my duty.\r\n\r\nI settle for a solitary Harthorn tree. I take the ashes from my coat, and without further ceremony, scatter them, just as mother asked. I close my eyes, and see a vision of her in the garden of the old house in Darat; the large flat pebbles and the slow dry leat; the low branches and the table of dried fruits; mother asleep in her wicker chair. In the Night Desert, a woollen rodent skips by, its peeled eyes with a watery glint like my own.  \r\n\r\nI sit and wait for them to show, which they do. I hand over the gun. I sign beneath a list of my crimes, which has been exaggerated beyond recognition. One of them is \"leaving a vulnerable mule unattended\". Poor Mo, I hope he will fare better without me, and not be made to toil. Perhaps they'll have him look for this pirate king. As for me; one way or another, the Saborians and Bandinians are prone to cutting their lives short.
codex.13a5936d6d9c0f7158675b8ab51f23fd=3rd Cob, 2866. \nEveryone is talking about him, at school I mean. Kouros' music is amazing, but it's his pictures that are really hot.\n\nThe oldies say he is ungodly thin, and ask us what's wrong with Saborian musicians. Everything, that's what. \n\nI drew one of him looking out of a window, and one sitting cross-legged, thinking. I think my sketches are pretty ok.
codex.b573a5016c85d7014727a8fc826924a6=17th Cob 2866\r\nOh I'm god, Oh I'm god - he is coming to Redusa on a frillship next month!\r\n\r\nApparently he is from Melliflua, wherever that is.\r\n\r\nI'm not telling dad, I'm just going to go. Mari says she can get us tickets, her mum works at the skyport.
codex.fdbd0fe7bad402e8201e52e703cbf95c=14th Ichthuna 2866\nMari says there are no tickets to see Kouros. The frillship is only \"flying over\", and it's not actually going to land. My theory is the Stalk think it'll unbalance us, like the books and everything else. \n\nI looked forward to this for weeks. We can still play his records, but I'm so mad, I wanted to see him. How could he let me down? I am god.
codex.48d7686a09f0de7d3ff3196daa794832=9th Babbo 2866\r\nI'm sick of Redusa. It's so sterile. \r\nIf this is all there is, what do the ones that have risen do? It must be so dull in Aetherium.\r\n\r\nDid you know that Melliflua is the fourth largest principality in Foundation, and that they love drama. What is drama!?
codex.dec95c026a6e1ec5b5bed8b0a8da7218=20th Kif 2866 \r\nMari agreed! We spoke, and we agreed on it. We're doing it!\r\n\r\nSometimes when you have a glass of water on a table, and it's all perfect and still, you just want to knock it over. Do you get that?
codex.dd5698f9fedfa0bcfd410c16ca72829f=1st Wewe 2867\r\nI haven't told Mari, but I'm so scared. She seems to be fine with all of this, that we're here, in Kubo. It's so dirty in the caravansary, and I don't understand what anyone is saying.\r\n   \r\nI don't like it here. I want to go home.
codex.b622974ecb0a5c03476f79370975257b=2nd Wewe 2867\r\nI've checked the skyship times, and there's one tomorrow back to Momoros, and we can catch another from there back to Redusa the day after we land. \r\n\r\nToday was better. Ok we didn't see Kouros, but we did see his poster! I still love him. We had some weird food - everything's so dirty, and I swear the guy who made mine had dirty hands. \r\n\r\nWe did some shopping, I got an amazing red dress with a gap at the hip (just like the girls on Kouros' poster), but then Mari and I argued.
codex.e3a581f8656f1eaf344efa771c15e395=4th Wewe 2867\r\nWe're still here. I got Mari to agree to go back, but storms delayed the flight until the day after tomorrow. Mari said she's only going back with me because she doesn't want to stay here on her own. We're not really talking.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I went a bit further into town, and it was really creepy. It was so loud, and there were people everywhere, it was chaos. Then a drunk old guy hit on me in a rug shop, so I went back to the caravansary, and I was kind of glad to see Mari again. 
codex.e2b51adb79c15e915a6b1e783c45cac0=5th Wewe 2867\nLast night was amazing! Amazing! \n\nWe were talking to the owner, saying we were going back to Sabor tomorrow. He speaks Saborian pretty well. He was crying, putting his hands in the air, saying it was a terrible shame. He's been really friendly the whole week, telling us where we can find this, that and the other - kind of creepy actually. Anyway we told him we were really disappointed not to catch a glimpse of Kouros, and had no idea the city would be this big.\n\nAnyway, he starts laughing really hard, which wasn't like him at all, I mean he seemed really kind until that moment, and then he just seemed like a bastard, laughing at us.  \n\nThen, when he finally manages to stop, he says, \"My cousin is Kouros.\" Then he falls on his knees, and starts laughing even harder, slapping the reception desk. Then we start laughing, but we don't know why!\n\nFinally, like ages later, when we've stopped laughing, he says he will take us to meet him tomorrow! Amazing!
codex.1602f3f91229b7f7c83ffe214348e3f4=6th Wewe 2867\r\nHere's the problem. If we go tonight with Hamesh (the laughing guy), we're going to miss the skyship, and be here another two weeks! Dad still doesn't know where I am. I mean he doesn't own me, you know, but he would probably like to know.
codex.96178efc9afacf71301863d62b2d91d1=7th Wewe 2867\r\nOh I'm god, we stayed in Melliflua! What a night it turned out to be...\r\n\r\nHamesh took us over to the massive habitat they called a \"house\", which is crawling with ivy. The difference between the grandeur of this building and, for example, any other I had seen in Kubo, was incredible. The door opened, and a servant appeared! I said it was cruel to have servants, Mari said \"better to have a servant in plain sight, than for them to toil unseen.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, we were led to a grand and fragrant ballroom. There were cushions on the floors. The walls were made of the most brilliant red and dark green silks. There were hundreds of people there. Kouros' music was playing - I know all the words, but I had to pretend I knew what they meant when I danced.\r\n\r\nThen I saw him. He was so elegant, his black sweep of hair, his wild green eyes. But on his arm was an elegant woman. My heart sank, but I tried not to let it show as Hamesh introduced us.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a huge fan,\" I said. I must have sounded stupid, even though I practiced the phrase all day. Kouros smiled politely, said something to Hamesh, and moved on. But before there was time for me to feel gloomy, Hamesh showed us to a table, and we were served some amazing food, and wine in long carafes. We chatted for hours with the people there, they were all really nice - and happy to try their Saborian on us. \r\n\r\nGoes a bit hazy after that. Spent today recovering.
codex.84527dfe62b249ce8980a8b77b48c338=8th Wewe 2867\r\n\r\nWe met up with some of the people from Hamesh' place, and they planned for us to go to a weavery. The weaveries are places you can go to make stuff (like anything), and play games and relax on the grass. It was a bit cold today, but we had a great time. \r\n\r\nTimor is the guy I like the most, but I think Mari likes him too. We were talking about Kouros' party, and I put my foot in it. I was talking about how beautiful his girlfriend was, and Timor was like \"woah, no that's not a girl, it's a guy-girl.\"\r\n\r\nThen he had to explain about the god Baliandri, and all of that. But now I know!
codex.2d78dc7c563ea89f17e5e44f3517fb6d=11th Wewe 2867\nThey always used to brag about how we have no need for money back home. But here I'm paying for stuff using my entitlement book - cutout, the stamps are really valuable here. It's basically like money. So we do have money, it just doesn't look like money. 
codex.1d0698d833e635728daa228efc3ee138=17th Wewe 2867\r\nI've actually started to learn a bit of Mellifluan. It's a beautiful sounding language, I just don't really understand what any of it means!\r\n\r\nSaw a horrible thing today. We were on a walk to a small town where they make traditional bread. There were these men all dressed in rags, asking for money. They looked really ill, about to die - they weren't even old enough to rise. I felt sick, and so sorry for them. I've never seen anything like it. It would never be allowed to happen like that back home. \r\n\r\nMari said that's because I'd never seen how the farmers and the other Pilipai live, outside the walls, \"and, what about the Bandini?\" she said. She was really passionate about it, and knew a lot more than me, and it made me feel stupid in front of the others.
codex.9a63f0b155f8bcaecd0eb8f06509887a=10th Nuess 2905\r\nI was going through the things in the outhouse, and I found this! I feel so old. How could I have fancied that Timor? He was an awfully vain young man. Anyway, I'm still here in Kubo. Well, slightly south of it. I'm a Saborian language teacher. My husband runs the school, but don't be disappointed, he's a musician too - plays the Pati-pikk, and he's much more handsome than Kouros!
codex.3bde84bcada1cbf29dc733e79b8e59ab=The Terminal\n\nI confront him, though I do not shout. I just tell him I think it ungodly. Then he raises his hand to me, like he did to the little girl, so I raise mine. \n\nBut I've got ahead, let me go back... \n\nHaving shown ability in my first assignments  - a year as a steward, three as a doctor, and one as a soldier, I am recommended by my Agbanese peers to the godhands. The godhands are keen for new recruits, I see from the advertisements, and I wonder if the rumours about an uprising in Conos are true.\nStill, it is natural that I should gravitate towards their institution, it being among the most celebrated of all assignments, along with being an Essedari, or part of the assembly. \n\nI am summoned to the Stalk for evaluation. Having spent my life in the north-east, I know going to the capital will be good for me. I say goodbye to mother, and leave a message at Agbana cloistrum for the man I think is my father. Then I take a skyship to Redusa through the northern desert. \n\nThe godhand academy is a burr of a building in the shadow of the Stalk. It is prickly outside and in. Behind the front desk of the godhand Academy, a walnut-mouthed woman shuffles papers. She looks at my resume and frowns. I know she thinks a provincial like me will have to learn fast just to keep up.\n\n\"Upstairs, third right.\"\n\nI head up and open the door to the dorm.
codex.ece2feaae9e9f53dd1ced85510f7cff5=The dorm is dark, and I began to wonder if I have taken a wrong turn. I inch inward, looking for a switch.\nSuddenly there is a roar, and the lights come up. I see a platoon of wicked faces. Music starts up on the player, and someone yanks my trousers down to the ankles. Hands tear at my top, despite my best efforts to hold on. Then, I am awash with oil, and bundled to the floor. Just as I am about to be crushed by the weight of many muscular bodies, they relent. \n\n\"What is this?\" I moan with my head still pressed to the soft matting. \nI feel the heat of an expectant silence. I sit up and wipe lubricant from my eyes.\nLooming over me is a brute about seven feet tall, and almost as broad. He looks as hard as a bronze statue. I only know he's alive because of his twitching plate-like pectorals.\n\nThe crowd form a natural arena, and I watch aghast as the ogre reaches into the bucket for a mighty palmful of the gunk, which he then proceeds to smear liberally over himself. Then with the same crane-like hand, he lifts me up, and throws me back down with a crunch.\nThrough the sickening dizziness, a sense of injustice wells up in me. I'd have to show spirit, or I'd be forever known a coward. \nI roll through the giant's legs, and from behind, hook a kick up between them. He immediately drops to the floor clutching himself, wheezing. \n\nThere is a horrified gasp around the room. \n\n\"What's your problem?\" says a guy, placing a comforting arm around the oily monster, who has begun to sob.\n\n\"You're supposed to just take the hit,\" a punchy girl says, \"everybody knows that.\"
codex.fde98da24f97c8136befaab9f13d177a=Of course, the incident stuck with me. I quickly discovered that being from Agbana was a disadvantage. I hadn't been primed for service like the Redusans, they seemed to have spent their lives building up to it.\r\n\r\nI had few allies in my first week. Strangely though, the giant - whose name was Arnau - became a firm friend. I discovered that he himself, though complicit in my initiation, was roundly regarded as a buffoon. His size belied a gentleness that our first encounter would never have had me believe.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we eat?\" He'd say.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" I'd say.\r\n\r\nWhen not eating, most of the day was spent in the gym, which suited me well enough. I'd been one of the few to climb the Apotheon in Agbana, and physically, I had a bit of everything. I sometimes heard mutterings that the Redusan Apotheon was harder, but I knew it was the locals dirt-talking me.
codex.9023cfb5c6580c8b3a057f1f2bb66997=About halfway through the second week, I underwent an \"aptitude interview\". \r\nI was shown up to a room in the Stalk. Through the thick glass, it was possible to see the wheels of Redusa, the spokes branching out of each sector, without hearing the hum of the machine.\r\n\r\nI only saw the thick neck, at first. Then, as the interrogation began, he spun around. His faceguard was a grander version of my own, with jagged black and red blades. When he turned to the side I could see his shaven head, and his flabby shoulders hunched forward like a dog's.\r\n\r\n\"I am Overseer Bulgus. Five questions, same as the others. Don't answer wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHe bounced his fist on his desk, and the five pips of authority rattled on his cuff.\r\n\r\n\"The first. If I walked you to the rising place right now, a gun against your head, could you ascend?\"\r\n\r\nI licked my cracked lips. \r\n\r\n\"I could.\"\r\n\r\nThere were scars across his shins and calves. His frame was squat and meaty. \r\n\r\n\"The second. I was born a Bandinian. How can I be a citizen of Redusa, and a citizen of Sabor?\"\r\n\r\nI paused. No Bandinian was ever a citizen.\r\n\r\n\"Because you're lying, Overseer,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThe mask turned sharply to face me. \r\n\r\n\"Third. What assignment do you dream of?\"\r\n\r\nI had prepared, and knew the only answer I could give, even if I did not entirely believe it.\r\n\r\n\"All assignments are equal, Overseer.\"\r\n\r\n\"So are you saying you won't enjoy it?\"\r\n\r\nThat wasn't one of the official questions I had prepared for.\r\n\r\n\"I will enjoy it. I enjoy work, wherever I am placed.\"\r\n\r\nBulgus stamped his foot and the floor shook.
codex.81992a7baa45bd0181edcd780650adf2=\"Stop toeing the line, and speak your mind man! You will, as a godhand, enjoy it. You will enjoy feeding Bandinian rebels the fingers of Verduban protesters. You will enjoy burning their houses down, and you will enjoy making Sabor great again. It says here you were a soldier-\"\r\n\r\nHe prodded the paper with a fat finger.\r\n\r\n\"-but I don't see it. You've lived like a dead man, and if you don't start coming to life, I'm going to have to beat you into life. If the gods can't do enough to keep our cities pure, we need citizens on the ground carrying out their will, not shirkers and quitters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Overseer.\"\r\n\r\nBulgus straightened the toga beneath his blue plate armour. \r\n\r\n\"Do you accept, that as a godhand, no other assignment will be open to you, until your day of ascension?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Overseer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lastly. Do you agree to serve Sabor, no matter what order you are given?\" \r\n\r\n\"Yes, Overseer.\"
codex.e4962b714f88732971459fb266dfac07=A month later, the trials finished, and about half of the godhand candidates were retained, with the rest dismissed. To my surprise, I was kept on, though I could not think on what merit. Proudly I collected my single pip, and pinned it to my uniform.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for us to be posted, I was sent back to Agbana. By coincidence, the soft-hearted giant Arnau was too, and I was pleased I could show him around my home city. What I didn't realise, was that we'd be going to parts of it I'd never seen.  \r\n\r\n\"We need to find the Terminal,\" Arnau said, as our ship drifted down to the mooring platform. \r\n\r\n\"Terminal?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Agbana's godhand headquarters, it's hidden,\" he grunted.\r\n\r\n\"Because of dissidents? Yes, I suppose there's as much trouble here as anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nIn all those years, I'd never seen trouble in Agbana. Life always seemed so perfect. But then, I had never really looked beyond the translucent struts of the hub, or the marble walls of the cloistrum. My old life flashed before me like a curious dream. Not everyone saw what godhands saw, sealing up the cracks where ugliness seeped in, keeping the dream alive.
codex.9e45b6e1b82558e5e805a0286c823fb9=Arnau and I located the stone that marked the entrance to the Terminal. We followed a line in the walkway from the base of the stone around several blocks of habitats, finally coming to an unmarked door on the perimeter.\r\n\r\nOnce we had shown them our papers, they took us on a tour of the facility. It was here where the godhands serviced skyships, equipping them with the latest machinery. The patrol ships floated up and out through a small retractable door in the roof. \r\n\r\nI was pleased to find the atmosphere more relaxed than it had been at the academy. We reported to our commander, a man with three pips on his lapel. He told us to \"clean out the sewers\". Most citizens never have cause to visit the sewage works, let alone be asked to clean there. Cleaning was a task for Pilipai. A Pilipus never had to struggle for apotheosis, or worry about their fellow man, so a bit of gentle manual labour was a sub-condition of our co-existence.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, the \"cleaning\" was altogether more in line with the duties of a godhand, since we were sent there to enforce the law. We were to evict the illegals that camped in the pipes from time-to-time. \r\n\"It's not glamourous, but it keeps harmony,\" the commander said. \"Most will be smugglers, others just layabouts without any ambitions at all. Do what must be done, what you have sworn to do.\"
codex.6aa3b1c1ad6a52785fa93fed1daed67b=I was haunted by the notion that I'd be stuck as a godhand until ascension. My reservations about the assignment grew, and I began to wonder if I'd ever see things the same.\r\n  \r\nAfter the sewer episode, we were sent on elevator duty. As the main access points to the city from the ground, it was important experience for us. The elevators took up people, but also food grown outside of the city by the Pilipai. Their blood was as Saborian as ours, and some had even been citizens once, but lately, their lives had changed.\r\n\r\nThe cities wanted more from farmers every year. If there was a poor harvest, when they'd paid their tithe, there'd be nothing left to feed their families. It was part of our job to ensure that these Pilipai met their quotas, or soon it'd be the citizens who suffered instead.\r\n\r\n\"Come! Gather round, ask your children to each collect a fruit. It is a reward for all you have done for us,\" I lied.\r\n\r\nThe children of the Pilipai rushed from their parents' sides to the table, desperate for the dripping-ripe fruit. As soon as they were close enough, we snatched them up and held them captive.\r\n\r\n\"Return in seven days with your tithes, or your children shall be put to work in the mines, and forevermore treated with the disdain afforded a Bandini,\" I read from memory. I couldn't look them in the eyes. These were good, honest folk, not criminals like the Bandini.
codex.d37eca4b1c1e05915521c03bda045f5b=I confront him, though I do not shout. I just tell him I think it ungodly. Then he raises his hand to me, like he did to the little girl, so I raise mine.\n\nI pull off his helmet. I strike him in the chest, in the belly, in the eye. He is winded, I am bruised.\n\nThe girl's eye is swollen. Her father tries to wake her, but she is still. He picks her up, and carries her on his back. Her mother embraces them both. That is family, that is belonging, that is a life that knows the meaning of death.\n\nI take off my mask and throw it at the godhand's feet. I climb aboard their wagon, and I fade into the wilderness.
codex.37d978debe6c71d204c4c42558e9b5ce=The Buccaneers of Vinicoti (Abridged)\nTranslated from the original Mellifluan by Banton, a rammybobble survivor. \n\nI have been entreated by my dear Chabuti friends, Dr. Dvangeti (now sadly departed) and the man I gravely misjudged, Captain Gerundin, to relate to you the happenings on the isle of Nicabocar, all those years ago. It all began with the arrival of a carnival, their chequered sails hoving into port, and every Fasio louse creeping out from beneath his log.\n\nI remember as if it were yesterday, how Dr. Dvangeti, standing at my father's bedside, described the scenes at the pier, and that my father gave a disapproving nod. Fool youth that I was, I remained in the room only half as long as was polite, before rushing down the stairs and bursting out of the front door.\n\nThe pati-pikks squawked, and the tom-drummers rattled. The nanban smoked on their griddles and the dancing girls smirked. Fire sticks whorled like bodies of the heavens, and every distraction bore a whiff of danger. Wanting to assert my sophistication, I was quickly drawn to the throwing bar. A single concon was perched at the far end, and a scrawny man was distributing sets of three polished wooden throwing balls at the near. I remember his hat filled me with terror, for it was just the kind of black hat a nefarious man would wear, buckled grimly around the middle, and rather too upright in its manner. His left eye was trying to escape its socket, and the right already had.
codex.69ad7a8f75a82018c3875c6a86c1f3b4=Above the bar was an ornate pair of pizzles, flinted and gilded, the star prize. I paid, was given my three balls, and took up position. I was so eager to claim the guns, that my first throw missed by a wild margin, thudding against the rug behind the concons. Realising I was being watched by a small crowd, I was determined to appear more calculated with my second shot. The resulting throw lacked instinct, and even before the moment of release I knew the ball did not desire to hit its mark. The crowd groaned, but goaded me on for my final attempt.\r\n\r\nWith this, the third, I was so convinced the feat could not be achieved, that I threw with more liberty again. In so doing, my throw achieved the perfect balance. The wooden ball planed sweetly through the air, and with a sharp crack, the concon-king was deposed. There was a great cheer, and the one-eyed stallman hawked and spat on the straw carpet.\r\n\r\n\"Wellun, boy,\" he said, in the most grudging possible tone, \"pick ee reward.\" 
codex.ab7532972f90de499477cd915fffd65e=He parted a dank curtain, where a forlorn menagerie of animals slumped, their stuffing protruding from the seams.\r\n\r\n\"But Sir,\" I said, \"I presumed the guns would be my reward?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Shabo, no!\" the stallman cackled wickedly. He spat on the floor again, and I saw he only had one tooth. \r\n\r\n\"But then the stall is misleading,\" I said, \"pride of place is given to the guns, while those festering stitchbags were not even in plain sight.\" \r\n\r\nI couldn't help but look into the empty eye socket, and saw the scratchmarks there.\r\n\r\n\"Three hits in three, for the guns,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But it doesn't say that anywhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Shabo, do you critique me?\" he said with a brutality I had not anticipated. There was something authentic about his rage that implied a good deal of practice, and I was about to withdraw, when a noble spectator piped up in my defence.\r\n\r\n\"The boy hit the concon clean on its pate. If you're a man at all, you've an obligation to gee'im what he desires.\"  \r\n\r\n\"You can stop your hole mate, or there'll be a big hole in yer belly,\" retorted the stall man.
codex.07f9eb1551cd98d0dcbba383beee478b=The spectator drew his rapier, and lurched suddenly toward the stall man, who raised his own scimitar and deflected it. It is these brief moments I still dream of some nights, such were their lasting significance. Seeing my chance, I reached up and seized the pair of pistols I'd longed for. I frantically primed them as well as I knew how, and lined up the skeletal stallman in my sights. As a matter of honour I'd decided I must vouch for the man who had come to my aid.\r\n\r\nThough my champion was fit and strong, and must have fancied his chances against a skinny one-eyed man, it became clear that there would only be one winner of the duel. Seeing the nimble and well-instructed movements of the fearsome stall man, and being unable to muster the courage to pull the trigger, I side-armed my guns like a coward, and sank backward into a crowd of bodies. They had rushed from up and down the pier to see the fight, and being so small I had to squirm my way through. When I finally broke through their ranks, I heard a piercing yelp from the arena behind me, and knew at once my champion had fallen. \r\n\r\n\"Where are me guns ye maggot?!\" I heard the one-eyed knave cry, and I sprinted home, as fast as my legs could carry me.
codex.6fc11b18d35b3fc96e12dc23f06f0af2=The next few days and weeks, I presumed to conceal my winnings. I had stowed them away in the armoire, and when my studies were done of a morning, I'd open the bottom drawer and peek beneath the handkerchief I'd covered them with. Oh how I adored the delicious metalwork - which on both guns depicted bustling crabs and bony dice. My stupidity even extended to looking down the barrels in the hope of some insight as to why I found these tools of death so fascinating. \r\n\r\nMuch to my father's surprise, I did not once return to the carnival at the pier, and instead remained resolutely indoors. Clearly he was prepared to forbid me from returning to the carnival once he'd realised it was something I might actually enjoy, and was greatly disappointed that I now denied him the opportunity to express his authority. \r\n\r\nDr. Dvangeti's noticed father's general surliness, and put it down to a lack of fresh air. Father was prescribed a wheeled chair, and sent away to a retreat in the mountains to pick wildflowers. It left mother and I at odds, for she lacked the same licence in enforcing my studies, and made weak threats to report my lack of application to father. But just when I had forgotten the incident that kept me away from the carnival, it surfaced again in the most unnatural fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark omen my mother discovered that night. A crab the size of a dog, pinned by a knife to our family door. She rightly assumed this to be some mischief I had brought about, and dangled the poor crab in front of my face.\r\n \r\n\"What is this?\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the vulgar blade which scarcely protruded from its shell, and sweated at the thought of the force with which it must have been thrust. The one-eyed man come for revenge. I mumbled something to mother, and rushed to my room to check the pistols were still there.
codex.a478a2d8f0cf022315906edcc410ee49=\"There he be!\"\r\n\r\nThe rain lashed the bay, and Fasio glowed behind me as I ran. There were five of them, maybe six. I heard the shattershot of a pizzle and saw a puff of fire. There was a whistle, and bark split from the trees ahead. I kept to the shoreline and ran hard. If I stayed low, there was every chance they'd lose me. But then my ankle turned on the sand, and I fell. \r\n\r\n\"Hold it there boy.\"\r\n\r\nThey were too close to miss. I turned and cocked my pistols, training them on anything I saw move. One-eye stepped out from behind a tree, the water dripping from his mangy beard. \r\n\r\n\"Your flints are as damp as a hound's licker. And if that weren't enough, they're sham pizzles! They're for show boy, do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nI wept at those words, and there was a peal of laughter from the trees ahead and behind. I couldn't see them, but they were there.\r\n\r\n\"Hand'em over, and you'll live, boy.\"\r\n\r\nI got to my feet, and stepped gingerly over to one-eye, holding out the guns by their pommels. \r\n\r\n\"Thank you kindly,\" he said. Then he signalled, and I was snatched and bound by one of the ruffians.\r\n\r\n\"What'll we do with him, Potty?\" one of them said.\r\n\r\n\"You said I'd live,\" I managed, before the gag was fully over my mouth. \r\n\r\n\"Not your kind of livin'!\" cackled Potty, and they took me aboard their skyship.
codex.0b77b3395e6a576ebad48041385494aa=By admitting my resistance was broken, and that I was theirs to own, I managed to get off lightly. I sensed the presence of a young fellow like me had improved morale aboard ship, and the old dogs would ruffle my hair, or threw me bits of bread to watch me eat \"all uppity\". Still the manacles were a hinderance, and made cleaning the privy harder, so it was a proud moment when I was released and given a scrubbing brush for deck. \r\n\r\n\"One man broke the code,\" cackled One-eye, \"he usurps yer throne of muck.\"  \r\n\r\nOne-eye, known as \"Potty\", still continued to kick me affectionately in the spleen when'er he passed by. I was surprised to discover he was no more senior than the others. Stranger still, the pistols were not his, but belonged to the captain, who I was informed was not presently aboard. \r\n\r\nI had lost interest in the pistols. For one, they were to me, the cause of my present grief. Second, as Potty had been at pains to point out, they were never intended to fire a shot. Their purpose then, their significance? I did not think further on it since they had been locked away in Captain Skora's cabin.\r\n\r\nThe ship rocked down from the dusky clouds to the sweet isle of Nicabocar, where plumes of pipesmoke rose from bark rods, the Vinicotian girls sang, and moth-bitten sailors chewed the corks from casks and tilted firewater down their gullets.
codex.d9d21bdb03564ac088fb5657eb2d266c=That was the first time I saw him. What a different proposition to the others. Dressed in the attire of a Mellifluan painter, his sweeping beetle-red fabric light as air, he strutted up to the mooring like a piped riverhen. It turned out he had been ashore at Nicobocar for some time, and desired to debrief his crew on their nefarious reconnoitering. He beckoned from shore, and the crew sloped off to the inn. \r\nIf I ever wanted to get back home, I'd have to play along. Even so, I couldn't help but follow them to the inn when they had asked me to stay put. I kept my distance, and once they were all inside I crept up to the door to their meeting room, and opened it slightly. I peeked and saw Captain Skora float down upon his soft skirts. The other sailors gathered around him, mopping his brow, feeling his clothes, and combing his fashionably floppy hair. Potty did not join in the adoration, and sat awaiting his instructions with Kazimin, a gigantic man with tiny black eyes and a bloated steaming face. It wasn't long before the Captain got down to business.\r\n\r\n\"Clear away now, give us peace,\" said Skora to his crew, who as they left the inn, gibbered over the fine ornaments and clothes they had seen. Captain Skora whispered now, and I took the liberty of moving behind the ale trolley so as to hear.
codex.5316c6a364a26242b451510663dd25d5=\"So, how did you come across them?\"\r\n\"The conconman had them, as you prophesied,\" said Potty.\r\n\"What did you do with his body?\" \r\n\"I slung it into the river,\" said Kazimin.\r\n\"Good and weighted down,\" said Potty, \"then we kept up the charade of stall-keeping until the carnival was concluded.\"\r\n\"We did have a further trouble...\" began Kazimin, but Potty slapped him roughly on the cheek, and the giant was quieted.\r\n\"Well where are they?\" said the captain, his great frilled sleeves flopping here and there.\r\n\"Just here,\" said Potty, unwrapping the wretched things from their 'kerchiefs and holding them up to the candle light. It hurt me to see their glimmer again. \r\nThe Captain pried them impatiently from Potty's grasp.\r\n\"Yes...hmmn...\" he said, running his finger over the golden filigree of barrel and hilt. He lay one back-to-back on the table with the other. At that moment, it struck me what was odd about them. The numbers on the dice were not identical on both pistols. \r\n\"We head to the gaol tonight. We have what we need,\" said Captain Skora, placing the pistols on his table.\r\n\r\nI was still puzzling over the dice. Hoping to see them more closely, I wrenched myself up over the trolley, only to topple a lewd tankard which spilled its liquor everywhere. The barwoman screeched and put her hands to her mouth. In an instant, Captain Skora had drawn his thin sword and was holding it to my throat.
codex.1554c678f526f8e11ef874238b1ccbd7=\"Who is this?\" he said, addressing everyone at the inn. He feigned surprise when Kazimin spoke.\r\n\"He's the trouble.\" \r\nKazimin gave Potty a victorious look. \r\n\"Then why is the trouble still trouble?\"\r\n\"I thought he'd be of use alive,\" said Potty, \"a cunning little swindler he is. One of us I'd add, if he were worked upon, and schooled in our ways.\"\r\n\"As Captain, I'd be the one to say..\" said Skora, turning the sword tip on Potty, \"..if he's right for us, wouldn't I?\"\r\nSomething like panic came over me, and I jumped between the Captain's legs, grabbed up his garment on the near side, and tugged sharply as I scrambled out from the other. Skora went head-over-feet, and his sword rattled upward into the air. Kazimin and Potty both took cover as the blade somersaulted and stuck end-first in the floor. \r\nBy this time, I'd managed to get my hands on the mock pistols, and danced out of the door. \r\n\r\nThis time I would not be caught so easily. I bolted into the trees behind the inn, and leapt upon the bough of a friendly-looking tree, scaling it as fast and high as I could. I caught my breath at the top. From the vantage point, I was able to see the thugs led by the fragrant Skora. He frothed at them for their stupidity as they walked the sand, shining their lanterns vainly along the line of trees.\r\n\r\nI stayed in the tree long after they had gone back inside. By the light of the moon I looked at the two pistols. There were five dice engraved on each. On the right, one, six, one, six, one. On the left six, one, six, one, six. I thought carefully. One totalled fifteen, the other twenty, was that significant? I looked inland where the jungle climbed toward the foothills, and when I fell asleep, I dreamt I was a monkey cavorting between the branches.
codex.f39159900f46607232045ba3af4e80ee=The next day began with a violent storm, and I was flushed down from my tree. The raindrops swelled and smushed like fruit, and I dashed beneath a woodshed. It was full of spiders. Just as the rain slowed, I heard their voices carry.\r\n\r\n\"I guarantee it is renembered sir,\" said Kazimin presenting a bent reddish fruit, \"I have scored it on the peel of this nanban.\"\r\n\"We will find the boy and the guns later then,\" said Skora, as the two emerged from beside the inn. \r\n\"Where is Potty?\" Kazimin said, gormlessly. \r\n\"He is disgraced, and will lose his share. He mopes aboard ship, expecting forgiveness, when the plank is more likely. Come, we have much to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain swaggered along a barely discernible path through the greenery. Kazimin slunk after him, and I in the rear, at a safe distance, so that my feet couldn't be heard. For half the morning we walked, as the sun drank the puddles. Then the going became steep and narrow. Stiff corridors of rock watched us by, and seed pods swung and burst their fluff in the air, which drifted and stung my eyes.  \r\nFinally Captain Skora halted Kazimin at a high pass. A spit of a bridge periled over the chasm, where heavy plaits of water flowed.   \r\n\r\n\"Do you have the nanban?\" he said.\r\n\r\nKazimin produced something from his pocket, and looking at it, suddenly became rather sheepish. \r\n\r\n\"Well? Hand it over!\"\r\n\r\nInto the Captain's hand, Kazimin placed the peel of the nanban he had eaten. The peel was brown and withered, and the cipher he had scratched on it now indistinct.\r\n\r\n\"You ate it?\" said Skora, bellowing. \r\n\r\n\"I had a hankerin' for breakfast,\"\r\n\r\n\"You lubbering boob!\" said Skora, hopping from one foot to the other.
codex.5c90f2368600ad0bcb79991f52fef534=\"I can't be sure without it,\" said Kazimin, \"but it might be sixes and ones, ones and sixes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Six of one, and half a dozen of the other, eh?\" squawked Skora.\r\n\r\nThere was a rustling in the bushes, and the picaroons fell silent. Skora shushed Kazimin, and crept to a nearby bush, where he parted the leaves to reveal two faces staring back. The white faces were daubed in red paint, and they were carrying sharp pointed sticks. \r\n\r\n\"Oh hello,\" said Kazimin cheerfully. \r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" said she, the leader of the tribe, and stepped out of the foliage to lock arms with Kazimin in greeting, \"Come, this way.\"\r\n\r\nOff into the thickest part they went, and I followed, trying not to rustle. The land seemed to fall away either side to form a ridge. I smelt a meaty char, and saw a plume of smoke rising up ahead.
codex.856465e05b559fc0f33f96e25fd19e64=Sweat overloaded my brows, and weeped into my eyes. The dwellings in the clearing, which comprised a series of extravagant stilted towers, were as well-made as any in Fasio. Each topped with a gold crest, in the shapes of ears, legs and eyes among other things.  \r\nAt the centre of the village was a pit no more than five feet wide, over which Skora and Kazimin stood. It was surrounded by sharpened wooden stakes. \r\n\r\nSome instinct kept me back in the bushes. The whole scene wavered as if distorted by rising heat. I was right to be cautious, as it transpired that the whole village was present before me, so well camouflaged and still, that they were almost invisible. I saw a flicker of movement here and there, and the hair stood up on my neck. The paint-daubed faces, silently watching the scene at the pit unfold. \r\n\"Captain Gerundin!\" said Skora, into the pit. \r\n\"I, not being amenable to scollybottoms and winkletinkers, refuse to have a dialogue with you,\" came a croaky, tired voice. \r\n\"Stop blathering. I have your pizzles now, and you are about to witness me opening your chest. Or should I say.. my chest.\"\r\n\r\nKazimin stomped off to a tree, and dragged a great sea chest from beneath it. He brought it to rest at his master's feet. The conundrum of its clasped locks gleamed in the sun.   \r\n\"Here Kazimin. What are the numbers?\"\r\n\"All ones and sixes, on both left and right,\" said Kazimin.\r\n\"Which on which one, in which order?\" said Skora. \r\n\"One then the other on both.\"\r\n\"Beginning with one or six?\" growled Skora, who was now beside himself with anger.\r\n\"Aye,\" replied Kazimin, at which miscomprehension Skora saw fit to strike him heavily upon the nose. There was a bellow of laughter from the pit, and Gerundin stood up so I could just about see his haggard face. He was black with silver hair, an Ishgiruan. Never a more fearful-looking warrior had I chanced upon before, and thought it sensible they kept him contained.
codex.3fb3f29be6f37e02683a87ce5bc834ba=The night passed in waves. Whenever I awoke, I'd look over to the pit, and see Skora shaking Kazimin by the lapels, or threatening Captain Gerundin who laughed madly, or kicking the dust in exasperation. At one point, I heard a high-pitch chipping, and saw that Skora was hammering away at the lock. But the lock was so sturdy it bore no mark, and then the natives came out of their dwellings to complain about the noise. From the signage of the elder tribeswoman, I understood she was also agitated because her people had not seen their side of a bargain. Whatever bargain it was, it seemed obvious that Gerundin was a part of it.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn I crept towards the camp. Skora and the faithful Kazimin had finally fallen asleep with their heads resting on the chest. That made it tricky for me to open safely, without disturbing them, and I had no intention of leaving the isle of Nicobocar without uncovering the plot.\r\nI mustered up some courage, and decided to gamble upon the fearsome warrior's predicament counting in my favour. \r\nAfter all, isn't an enemy's enemy, a friend?
codex.0f241009a0d2f5c6170272989dd96eaa=I made a noise like a cicada.\nCaptain Gerundin murmured sleepily from the pit.\n\"Psst\" I said.\n\"Gahh!\" he started loudly, then stared up at me, eyes wide. \nWe listened nervously as his exclamation faded into the darkness. \n\"I will free you, but I will have your oath that you will help me escape this island,\" I whispered through the rows of tiny spines surrounding the pit. I had no inkling of how I would keep him to this promise. \nKazimin snorted suddenly, but did not awake.\nAfter a suitable pause, Gerundin spoke quietly in broken Mellifluan.\n\"Don't touch the spines. They're poisonous, and will turn your insides to mush.\"\nI moved my palms well away from the darts poking from the soil. \n\"How do I get you out?\" I said.\n\"Pull the thickest towards you,\" he gestured, \"no not that one. That one.\"\nI pulled the largest and to my surprise, it came free of the sandy soil. It was about three feet long. Its removal effected the collapse of an entire side of the pit, and the Captain was able to escape. The whole thing was wonderfully simple, and crucially, made very little noise. I could smell his rummy breath as he leaned down to me, and I wondered if I had made a mistake. \n\"Good work young man. I needn't ask why you're here,\" he said, glancing at the chest and back, and raising a white-grey eyebrow. \nOf course, I had no idea what lay within - some treasure perhaps. Immediately, I handed over the pistols presuming he knew how to use them should his captors wake up.\n\"O-ho!\" he said, stifling his delight, \"just remember. One-six, six-one. That means run.\"\nWith a caring touch, he lifted the snoring Captain and his stooge Kazimin aside, and began forthwith to adjust the combination according to the numbered dice on the pistols. With a satisfying clack, each brace unclasped, and the Captain lifted the lid. 
codex.b90660fa5c9440fbbbb5ce96895b46bc=\"It's empty,\" I whispered, looking at the red lining.\r\n\"It's O-PEN!\" shouted Gerundin into the night.\r\nThe alarm was raised. Within moments there was a general rattling, and then faces appeared beneath the lick of their torches. I felt cool metal bounce softly upon the nape of my neck, the two of us at the tips of their falcatas. \r\nFinally, the bleary-looking Captain Skora stood up, almost as astonished as I was at Captain Gerundin's daring. When he saw the open chest, he hurried over.\r\n\"I told you,\" said Gerundin smugly. \r\n\"What in Foundation! Where is it?!\" said Skora. \r\n\"It was never in there, it was always in here,\" he said, pointing at his temples. \r\n\"I don't believe you,\" he said. \r\nKazimin spotted me, but before he could strangle me, a mesh of falcatas came between us, and would not part for him.\r\n\"Heyy!\" he grumbled gormlessly. \r\nAt that moment, I felt a great deal more worried by the tribe than Skora and his lumber-brained aide. What was their stake in this? If the chest was empty, why had Gerundin not allowed us to escape when we had the chance? \r\nWherever the treasure was now - for only treasure could draw such men to such a place - it must be highly desirable, and small enough to have fit into this sea chest.
codex.9ee646acf0c08da95b78f2ad7c37a90a=\"Well, we cannot split the treasure,\" said Gerundin, \"so let us come to an agreement.\" \r\n\"What If I refuse your demands?\" said Skora. He and Kazimin also had falcatas to their necks. \r\n\"The best you can hope for, Skora, is to survive this episode unscathed,\" said Gerundin.\r\n\"Yes, consider our previous agreement broken off,\" said the tribeswoman, who had lost faith in the business, and now confiscated the ceremonial pistols and handed them over to the bold Captain Gerundin. \r\n\"You say you know the true place, will you make a deal with us?\" she said.\r\n\"I shall, and will uphold all the same terms of the former contract, including the part about the Verdubans...\"\r\n\"Of course,\" she said, \"that, and a small part of the treasure, is the only thing of interest to us.\"\r\nThere was a rumble around the camp, as the villagers tapped the butts of their falcatas on the ground in slow haunting unison.\r\n\"..provided, myself and the boy are unharmed,\" said Captain Gerundin.\r\nThe leader of the tribe looked me head to foot, then pressed my bicep between her two bony fingers. She chuckled and nodded.\r\n\"Very good,\" she said.\r\n\"Don't forget us!\" said Skora. \r\n\"Well, you came up with the idea about the Verdubans, which was a fine one,\" she said. \r\n\"Why, thank you,\" said Skora, brushing back his hair raffishly.\r\n\"But I don't trust you to see the thing through.\"\r\n\"Looks like freedom will be your only reward,\" said Gerundin.\r\n\"Heyy!\" said Kazimin, but a tribesman smacked his broad bottom with the shaft of his stick.\r\n\r\nWith that, Gerundin led our little party out of the village to the shoreline on the other side of the island.
codex.4620c09d87695bddf530a868e278f50f=Gerundin pointed to a small patch of sand which, auspiciously, had recently been disturbed. The leader of the tribe promptly stood over it. \r\n\"No treasure until we get the Verdubans,\" she said.\r\n\"Oh no, quite right,\" said Gerundin cordially.\r\n\r\nA little way up the beach so that it was also visible around from the next bay, a fire was built of matted palm and all the sticks and branches that could be found. I gathered its purpose was to lure a Verduban boat. Much to his dismay, Kazimin's firewater was confiscated and used as fuel, and we all fell silent under shade for several hours until the sun began to descend.\r\nI thought of running during those long hours, but to where? That's why I'd enlisted Gerundin's help, but to my dismay, he was proving himself to be just as selfish as the rest of them. \r\n\r\n\"A skyship!\" cried Kazimin. Sure enough it was. Two other vessels followed. I could tell from the ear-shaped print on one of the ship's pennants that it was the Verduban crossing we had been expecting. The fire had been enough to pique their interest, and they landed their vessel up the beach. \r\n\r\n\"By diplomacy I shall lure them out and into the jungle, where you can do with them as you see fit,\" said Gerundin.\r\n\"Bake them in the ground, slow-cook,\" said the leader of the tribe, licking her lips.\r\n\"Very good,\" said Gerundin nervously, holstering the fine pistols at his sides, \"I shall shortly return.\"
codex.7fbcc7c569cbde08c2ed87139dd92595=We watched Gerundin from afar, as he sunk over the sand to greet a Verduban, who had gotten off the boat. They conversed for a moment or so, before I saw Gerundin turn to us and raise his hands. He counted on his fingers. One, six, six, one. I set off at a sprint, too quick for the falcata-waving natives, who I caught off guard. Almost at the same moment, I saw the anchor on the skyship pulled, and Gerundin and the Verduban ambassador hop aboard.\r\n\r\nI was at top speed through the sand now, and I could hear shouts and the thud of sand behind me as the islanders followed. As the ship rose up, I caught hold of the trailing metal shank of an anchor, and swung on it, clutching with all my strength. \"Pull up!\" I heard the Verdubans cry, and as the anchor rose, I narrowly evaded the chop of several falcatas. \r\n\r\nThe beach below was a strange sight as we drifted up and away. At the near end, the cannibals, and at the other, Captain Skora and Kazimin, who instead of doing the sensible thing and running for dear life, were frantically scraping away at the sand where Gerundin had said the treasure was hidden. I doubted very much if there was anything buried there at all.\r\nEven as all the islanders had gathered around them, the pair continued to dig. At least the tribe would not go hungry, I thought. 
codex.50980091d2c090a74b76fe7a7b5c22b8=\"We feel terrible,\" said the grey Verduban man I had seen talking with Gerundin. \r\n\"Please, it isn't necessary to apologise,\" I said for the umpteenth time. If they hadn't just saved my life, these Verdubans would be unbearable. \r\n\"No indeed, do not trouble yourself with what could have happened,\" said Gerundin smiling, \"think of what did happen - the boy was saved! Besides, it is my fault that he was left to cotton on of his own accord.\"\r\n\"Why didn't you take me with you?\" I said.\r\n\"It would have been too suspicious to take you with me. I'm afraid I played on the bond the leader of the tribe thought existed between us.\"\r\n\"Are we not friends?\" I said sadly. He put an arm around my shoulder.\r\n\"Of course, my boy, of course. And I knew you were smart enough, and that you'd remember. One-six, six-one. You probably knew the meaning of those numbers all along.\"\r\n\"Did I?\"\r\n\"Aye. Let me ask you, what do you say was inside that chest?\"\r\n\"It was empty.\"\r\n\"Aye, but what was in it?\"\r\n\"The treasure?\"\r\n\"No, boy,\" laughed Gerundin, \"it was always empty.\"\r\n\"What then?\" \r\n\"Misdirection,\" he said, delighted with himself.\r\nI looked at the pistols as he took them from his holsters. I watched him cock the flints, undo the catches, hold them to my forehead, and pull the triggers.
codex.b7bbf1a1bb153713e270c7c65c0f25ea=There were two tiny pops, and from each barrel came a shred of paper. I saw the papers were two parts of a whole, and put them together. I looked at the complete picture. A hazy line formed an archipelago of islands, bays and reefs. In the centre, a thick black circle of ink hung over a small green island. This, I realised, was a treasure map.
codex.fa097e7b1282ea7ff0a32885fff9aae2=Last year my father was fifty. Joyous at the mortal life he had led, it came time for rising. But oh how we fretted when we discovered his book of stamps was lost! It seemed to have disappeared during the night from the chain on which he kept it. We searched our habitat high and low, but there was no sign. Not once did we think the matter could be \"criminal\".\r\n\r\nI recount the intrigue, because by doing so, I bring myself closer to god. You see I played a modest part in bringing the culprit to justice. Note that, since this will serve as testimony before the Overseer, I must not spare a detail, and hope not to cause offence by it.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate aftermath of the book's disappearance, my father applied to rise without it. The office of the Utopianist refused him, and worse, questioned his citizenship in the absence of the document! The godhands investigating the happening at first believed my father's story, but doubt crept in, despite ample proof that we, his children, were citizens. The tenets absolved the godhands from providing any further assistance, and it became clear we would have to find the book ourselves.
codex.83fe069a489c5b5b5a76ad947bcbf155=But before we come to the investigation, I must tell you a little of my family. My father, who met my mother at the cloistrum like his other mistresses, is a good man. He looked after me from the day I was born, trading his stamps for breast milk, cradling me in his arms. Of course, the Pilipai would gather at the fringes of our life, and when father's presence was required elsewhere, they kept my tiny toes powdered. \r\n\r\nMy brothers fought a lot. Brother Marico was younger, Patrus older, and I found myself the go-between. I would hold them apart and recite the mantras of Aetherium until their fury abated. What they fought over I don't know, since we had everything we could have wished for. \r\n\r\nWhen time came to school, father sent Patrus away to the academy in Momoros, deciding it would be healthier for my brothers to be kept apart. Marico remained in Agbana, attending the same academy as me, where we learned to respect each other. It was only shortly before the incident with the missing book, that Patrus decided he would return home, and being god, we freely accepted him. \r\n\r\nOf course, his long absence meant he was not well-known to us. It soon became apparent that Momoros had instilled in him bad habits, such as a general untidiness, laziness, and a lack of concern for his fellows. He was, as far as we were concerned, far from god. But we suffered him, as the fifth tenet goes, in order to self-improve.
codex.c8f5b68d8ff4dcf5118cf39cebd429a0=The only other persons of bearing on the mystery, are our family doctor, Mosphor, and our neighbour Comernicus. Mosphor was grizzled and looked very old, though I knew him in actual fact to be several years younger than father. He had no great burden of work in Agbana, and so could often found reclining in the leather chair in the hall. He would pass the time recounting the same old stories of medical successes over and over again, until he had bored himself to sleep.\r\n\r\nComernicus often came by too, he'd debate with the doctor, or play a few hands of the dice game. He was a young man, whose work seemed to be in the line of architecture. He was often complimentary about the modernity of our habitat, and even though the furnishings were identical to his, said he would \"much like to live in it\", which we always thought ungodly.   \r\n\r\nBut, on with the investigation. Of course, we had no idea what to do next, since no agency existed in Sabor catering for the solving of mysteries. We appealed to our friends, and one of them made an obnoxious suggestion that we at first dismissed - to receive a foreign expert in such matters. \r\n\r\nAs it turned out, our desperation being very great, we gave further thought to the proposition, and then acted upon it. The man in question was humble indeed, for it took many weeks correspondence back and forth between our country and the distant land they call Great Marsha to root him out. When we finally had this squat amphibian of a fellow in our net, so to speak, we brought him back to our habitat in Agbana and set him to work.
codex.9f846de324cc9977e1cb4cd34b77f0a5=Puggibun squelched up and down in gumshoes, asking this and that about our habits. His trousers were ludicrous, his smell dank, and he would occasionally let out a belch. I had mind to take him to the cloistrum and give him a good wash, but I dared not touch him for fear of disease. In spite of some quirks, his summary appeared sensible on the issue of the lost stamp book. \r\n\r\n\"It has been stolen, by persons unknown,\" he said gravely.      \r\n\r\nPuggibun assured us he wouldn't need a translator, but hearing this explanation, I was sure he must have made some linguistic mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Stolen?\" I said, \"What sort of word is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The book has been removed without permission,\" clarified the little green gentleman. \r\n\r\nAt this, my father and I gasped. My brothers stood to attention and began to survey the empty hall, as if the villain might still be at large. \r\n\r\n\"What do we do now?\" said father.\r\n\r\n\"I must be given time to investigate,\" said Puggibun, with a degree of impatience.
codex.ccd5c97471e7ab87cdde80d55aabfe0f=Never had I felt so degraded as this. If news spread of an injustice under our roof, I worried it might have us exiled for negligence. But who could have done such a thing? My first thought was the Pilipai. Perhaps one of our earthier cousins wished to try their hand as a citizen, and stole the book in the hope of assuming my father's identity, and his stamps.   \r\n\r\n\"No my lady, I do not think that is what has happened,\" said Puggibun, \"but you are wise to mention a possible motive. Notify the authorities that they should be on the lookout for your father's stampbook, wherever it could be used.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, we knew this meant gossip would spread. With heavy hearts we informed the storemasters, and the gatekeepers and so forth, that they should apprehend anyone with a book of entitlement bearing my father's name. I felt tainted, disembodied.\r\n\r\nPuggibun went about his business largely at the scene of the incident - my father's bedchamber. Having no particular business to attend, since my assignments are light, I followed the little man everywhere pressing for answers. \r\n\r\n\"Must you follow me about?\" He said, tutt-tutting.\r\n\r\n\"What have you found?\" I asked. \r\n\r\n\"At this time,\" he said with a huff, \"I do not know if I have found something or nothing. If you continue to hector me, I am sure it will be the latter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" I said, and I sat at the end of father's bed dreaming up solutions of my own.
codex.60f836d2e13178414f6484b846c553e9=Puggibun didn't think it was the Pilipai, so despite my reservations, I ruled them out as suspects. My suspicions fell easily upon the person I knew least well, my elder brother Patrus. \r\n\r\nThat he had only recently arrived home, added weight to the evidence against him. Over dinner he told father he was \"angry,\" at the way my father had treated him, by packing him off to Momoros to school. Their relationship was noticeably strained, father often storming out of the house at the tiniest provocation from Patrus.\r\n\r\nIn my view, father had every right to be disappointed in his son. When he could have been training to scale the apotheon, or taking up good causes, Patrus lounged about in his nightgown. He ate, drank, and threw things at Marico while he was trying to work. It was undignified, and not the sort of example we should be setting for the Pilipai, if we want them to respect us.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any notion of who it might be?\" I asked Puggibun.\r\n\r\n\"I am only looking for evidence. The evidence itself will tell the story,\" he said crossly, poking around in the flowerpot.
codex.9fac7d3ca8822b45a2d03a8c1fa45707=I decided Patrus was far too obvious. Perhaps instead it was Marico, who so obviously wanting rid of our brother, and knowing suspicion would fall on him, could himself have stolen it. I congratulated myself on my cleverness. I had no idea that foul play could be so thrilling!\r\n\r\n\"Hmm,\" said Puggibun, stirring through the ash in the fireplace, then walking over to the window to breathe the city air, \"one should never guess.\"  \r\n\r\nMaybe Marico wasn't that cruel. We are gods after all, and must be kind and noble. Besides, I can attest to him never having had such a streak since he was a teenager when he and Patrus used to fight. Ever since he has been nothing less than a chivalrous and caring young man. \r\n\r\nI thought of Comernicus, and his preoccupation with the alcoves and decor of our habitat, \"there's a lovely turn-of-the-century balance about it.\" \r\nPerhaps he covets it, and hopes with my father's exile the building shall become available for allocation. With his friends on the utopian committee, he will no doubt be able to swing things in his favour. It seems preposterous, yet this theft is like a little crack in the porcelain, it makes the whole world hum as if to shatter. \r\nWhen you are so used to having everything, you do so long for even the smallest amount of the illicit. But I've never known a Saborian act upon it! Who else? Doctor Mosphor? Surely not!
codex.12c2cc7754f7f2de777690e07dd26077=\"Come, gather round,\" said Puggibun, who had assembled everyone, including doctor Mosphor, in the hall. Puggibun was rather enjoying the plump olives the Pilipai had set out on the table.\r\n\r\n\"So. I have come to some conclusion about this mystery,\" he said, chewing. \r\n\r\n\"Have you found the book?\" said father.\r\n\r\n\"Yes and no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well where in Aetherium is it?\" interjected Patrus, taking a handful of olives for himself.\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" said Puggibun, sweeping a hand over his face testily, \"give me a moment to explain.\"\r\n\r\nHe began a slow walk around the room, his eyes jumping from one face to the next. Then he let out a tremendous belch.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon!\" Comernicus said, but Puggibun cut him off.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing I noticed,\" he said, \"was the lack of care by which the culprit removed this book of entitlements from its chain. A person who intended to use the book for his or herself, would also want the corner in which the chain is fastened.\"\r\n\r\n\"So the thief was in a hurry?\" said doctor Mosphor.\r\n\r\n\"Not just a thief. On this evidence alone, it is possible to call the criminal a libellist. This person wanted to bring the family name into disrepute. It is my belief the culprit wanted the owner of the book to lose his citizenship, suffer the shame of exile, and see his family dispersed. All this for a greater personal gain even than a book of stamps, and was the aspect of the case I found hardest to fathom.\"   \r\n\r\n\"Are you suggesting it was one of us?\" said brother Marico. Puggibun shuffled strangely and raised an eyebrow. \r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. Who else? The second piece of evidence makes it certain. There was ash in the fireplace, yet we are deep in summer. Is that not a curious thing? On closer inspection of the ash, I discovered the smallest sliver of the book which matched the pieces still attached to the chain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness!\" Said doctor Mosphor again, taking his feet down from the rocking chair. 
codex.dc1e0135c73bb6bd379984f21d23ad30=No-one seemed to know what to say next. So it was me that spoke up.\n\n\"Everything, from the very beginning has pointed that way. There has never been any evidence of one of these 'burglars'.\"\n\n\"Quite so. Which leads me to level my accusation. It has taken me some research to begin to grasp your customs in Sabor, but I feel my efforts now paid dividend.\"\n\nHe smiled like a frog.\n\n\"Who was it who stood most to lose by the book going missing? Your father, who sits here before us. Of all these other people which one of them had the greatest motive for wanting their father dispossessed of his citizenship?\"\n\nAll we could hear was the tot-tot-tot of the doctor pouring himself some wine.\n\n\"Well I'll tell you,\" he said. \n\n\"Wait,\" I said, \"I know who it was, and I know why they did it.\"\n\n<The rest of this text is missing>
codex.3ee6a89ca232ebf0d2311c7cadb70e0d=As I lower the rope down through the aperture in the cave ceiling, I think of my old friend Telemon, Sabor's first and last tyrant. \r\n\r\nWe met at Redusa University on the delta. A bright, white, optimistic school, with a rich tradition. Telemon and I shared a dorm. At first I thought him arrogant, filled with vitriol, but I grew fond of him, because I realised many of the things he said seemed true. \r\n\r\nWe used to attempt the Apotheon together. He was fitter, and I struggled to compete with him. How funny now - they say if Telemon looks down, he can't see his knees for his belly. History fascinated us, and we used to argue about the Mellifluans. I remember he thought their third gender unnatural, and I disagreed, declaring that all things should be allowed to exist. But when it comes to warfare, I'm not so sure all things should.
codex.a96a4de29d60b8d7566fe341e4aa3de4=I started working on weapons around the same time Telemon and I used to meet at Molin's cafe. Our academy days were behind us, but we were still friends. We'd lunch high over the Redu delta, watching a thousand small brown bodies navigating the water channels in their gondolas, and like a mirror image, the river of skyships above. When he arrived, Telemon always looked out and said, \"We are god, and these are my people\", then we would both laugh. \r\n\r\nI remember a spectacular glass floor, and the otherworldly cuisine. At night, they held dances, and the skyships and boats were like candles all around. Molin used to come out and greet us, and he was especially fond of Telemon. They remain firm friends to this day, each so driven by their art, that life and family were left behind. Molin was old then, so is ancient now, Telemon's private chef and casual advisor. \r\n\r\nThe cafe's still up there, but I haven't been back. I won't watch the delta fold into the earth from up in the city. I prefer to be down here, among our Foundations, so when the big one comes I can be the first to go. \r\nWe are far from god now, if ever we were near.
codex.b7da90aa3f5c7175e8dbd8ee01afdb36=Telemon was a junior of the Assembly back then, but an idealist, and I thought it would take him far. I was his oldest friend, and he expected to make few others, in politics at least, saying his best chance was to thin out his enemies until he could pick off the few that were left. Even so, I think I misjudged how ruthless he could be. \r\n\r\nWe both used to sit there at Molin's, drinking vittles, committing heresy. It isn't on to brag in Sabor, you know, but we slipped our advancements and successes under our napkins like spies. Telemon was interested when I told him more about the weapons. At the time they were prototypes, abstracts. I said I was worried about how much Atlas they would use. Telemon agreed it was a risk, after all, the Atlas states had voted against them, two centuries before.\r\n\r\nMaviana helps me by winding the torch. The whirr, then the light fading up, until it is bright enough to reflect in the water below. She attaches the torch to the rope on the pulley, and the beam steadies. We see that more rock has fallen, and made islands in the pool like gritty porridge. There is a dull greening - little pinheads of light from the Atlas. We begin our descent. \r\n\r\nMy family tell me I'm old enough for the rising place now, but I won't go. Damn them for suggesting it! I've not done enough to join an Aetherium - if one exists. I'm as mortal as they come, and much the better for it. \r\nThe best I can hope for, is that when my time comes, I can learn to forgive myself. Thirty years ago I helped build those weapons and wheeled them in front of the Redusa assembly. I was just doing my bit, I was helping begin our end.
codex.053517ddb5b949fe656ef68f2c9c63d0=There's darkness, and I hear young Maviana breathe in sharply, but she's strong, and she cranks up the torch again. The beam settles upon the Atlas crags. There are a few isolated clumps. It is no wonder we are allowed down here, when there is little mining left to be done. Maviana wedges a seismometer into a crevice, and the pendulum bob swings immediately into action, flickering between one and two. \r\n\"1.775,\" she says, with a chirrup of excitement in her voice, relaying the readings up to Endrus. \r\n\"Check,\" Endrus verifies, scribbling on his pad in case we lose the raw data from the drums. It's all a formality of course, since no data we gather can change anything. \r\n\r\nGathering data just isn't the fashion. We let others do that, Gall or whoever, as long as we don't have to muddle ourselves with it. Science is bad, it challenges the existence of Aetherium.
codex.e649618aa198b2dc8e5cd6fc73f7fcc6=I am pleased to have such an accomplished scholar as Maviana by my side. She has twice the mind I had, and I had quite a mind. Maviana isn't sure if my observations and analysis add up, and thinks there'll be a more dramatic subsidence. I am sure she is right. M has started calling our foundations \"skin\" not \"crust\". I can find no evidence to disprove her theory, and I think she is greatly encouraged by my (fogeyish) support. Of course, I don't tell her that our research is of no consequence. If she knew how close we are to the end, she'd hate me for it, and I couldn't live with that. She is my torch, and all that gives me pleasure, is to see her succeed where I have failed.\r\n\r\nThe early foreshocks were sporadic, and we always knew when the next big quake was going to come - like the splash at the end of a drum roll. In the last three months, there have been few moments of peace. In the lofty heights of Redusa, the floating gardens and the high-risers, no vibration disturbs the peace to worry the inhabitants. The seamsters pore over their shining threads, the cooks their broth, and as long as they have the stone, Telemon's people are happy and afloat. No child is idle, no child starves. The four cities hover like seabirds over a stormy sea, playfully swooping as the waves grow higher and more violent. But if that sea whirlpooled away, what would those seabirds eat?
codex.008813aab9b759a81383d351dd600579=We all knew things were changing, and when it was proposed at the Assembly, the question of our duty to preserve was choked. I remember when we lived in harmony with the land, when we lived in harmony with its caretakers, the Pilipai. That was a golden age, but ages pass, busts on pedestals come toppling down. \r\n\r\nThe delta is drained, the animal bodies litter the empty runnels where water once gushed. That is not perfection. We cannot simply ascend into the clouds, up and up. Telemon says gods are \"unbound from the chains of the earth\". Yet there are chains aplenty - long lines of chains that bind the men, women and children of Darat to the mines, day and night scratching for stone, with nothing to look forward to but an early death.     \r\n\r\nBack then, I was so angry, I went to see him in person at the Committee office. I remember the skyship dropping down between the glimmering masts of the Stalk, and that I couldn't wait to get at his throat. I stormed in, bust the white door wide open, and Telemon just laughed. \r\n\r\n\"It's done now, isn't it?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It is slavery Telemon!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must preserve the cities. Nothing else matters.\"
codex.3f82c7c74f38ba687ca10295dfb23245=Much of my rage faded at that moment, and sadness slopped in. All the time I had spent with Telemon felt wasted, and our friendship failed. The man was grotesque, his godhands brutal, his propaganda copious. Then I reflected on what I had done. For the first time I felt responsible. War would come, and my weapons would take lives. \r\n\r\nSo it has come to pass - war with the Unity, and every day the ground shakes. We citizens are so naive: we've never seen military operations, we've no notion of the killing, and yet we take personal credit for each report of victory. What teaches us? It is the parades of Essedari, the precision ceremonial drills. The spoils of war triumphantly draped from our ships, the women and men of the Assembly stooping through garlands, and fighting puffs of confetti. Presentations by eager children to the grim-faced servicemen who've come back heroes. It is even the pageant celebrating the ascent of those that never came back that feeds our ego.
codex.a5a38bca93ab38798367e03cbb75ec5a=Endrus shouts from the top of the cavern. He says it's time to go. The readings have been going wild for an hour, and a few big shocks have come and gone. A new one gives a jolt, and Maviana stumbles into my arms. I help her up, and she is happy I've caught her. Surely I'm too old for that, I think, but I swear I see something in her eye. Let the thought at least comfort me, after all, what else is there? \r\n\r\nIn Redusa I shall be shamed for hanging onto life, I'll be dubbed a cowardly mortal, lose my citizenship. But believing ourselves to be gods is the greater crime, for how can we be both gods and monsters at once? I am surely not the only one who thinks this way, but I might be the only one not afraid to say it. \r\n \r\nWe begin to gather the equipment, but it's hard work staying upright. There's a big one coming. The Assembly thinks nothing of it. They're crazy as dogs, the same dogs that looked to little moon, and instead of seeing a marvel, saw resource. \r\n\r\n\"We believe it is made of Atlas,\" they said, \"we must prioritise a moon mission.\"\r\n\r\nEven if it were possible to get up there, beyond the airless border that encircles us, and if a thousand men and their tools began chipping away, what then? We'd be carving up another thing of beauty, leaving only a dull grey moon left to lullaby our children to sleep.
codex.64df5b04aa2bf9f09b2590b1cac8792a=Telemon just spoke over the radio. He said war was inevitable, and that Sabor must be preserved. \r\n\r\n\"...We are the envy of the world, we cannot fall...the Saborian way, is the only way. We are gods.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly, strongarmed by Bulgus and his godhands, will agree, and the war will go on. Bulgus is vindicated now Kioki have rejected peace, and he has Telemon's full support. \r\n\r\nThe dream of how things once were clings to us like film. We will not relinquish the past if we still think we live in it. I hope somewhere inside Telemon is hurting, and that I have made him hurt. I look at Maviana and she looks back at me. She's afraid. I'm afraid. We carry on winching the reels up to Endrus.
codex.d7ef187a44c3e333c36ba0e7f2af326c=One day, I became a seismologist. Some buildings collapsed in Bandinia and no-one knew why. There had never been quakes in Foundation before, and so there were no seismologists. I was old, I felt guilty - so I left the university, strapped on my boots, and hid myself away to measure vibrations. \r\n\r\nWe knew it must be the stones. Atlas for the fleets of airships and their guns, Atlas for the four cities, the towers and the 'scrapers - our addiction had to be fed. The cavities wince and stir with every excavation. Mother nature yelps and shivers with pain.  \r\n\r\nSuddenly a punch in the gut, and it winds me. Endrus tumbles on top of me, and the torch spins like a lighthouse across my face, then falls far away. The rocks from above beat my head, and I taste blood. 
codex.e6a37b68f93212d47ffa4365abde31a3=I am with the Pekoe now. An arc of glass, the bright sun and the broad-leaved trees all around, space to write these memoirs. I am bleeding slowly, and nothing can be done for me. The beautiful nurses busy about with their masks. I imagine, but do not know, that they anxious for me. But I am at peace.\r\nI am at peace because I believe, whatever lies down there, beneath the crust, has a plan for us all. None of us have recognised Foundation's power, save for perhaps the Deep Marsha and the Ratfolk, who are so well-attuned to spiritual disturbances. Those things from below, whatever they be, give me hope.\r\n\r\nYet in the distance I see the stormcloud coming this way, it gathers every way, the great anvil from which a new world will be forged. I am at the wall now, and I know beyond I can be with those I loved and lived. Maviana and more besides. I have become a better person for these trials, and if my mind joins the Aetherium after all, I can make a great contribution there, a noble one. In death, I am god.
codex.f7c341dbede39c77394da9b11cb1d5c5=The Tale of the Kindly Tailor - By Olamide Coria Arelevi\r\n\r\nMany, many, years ago, there was an Empress. Her name was Getta Renata, but the people called her Getta, and her only pleasure was to walk among them. \r\nWhen she was a small child, Getta crawled beyond her nursery, through the curtain of golden hair, and out into the courtyard. She was so small the sparrow guards did not see her, and she passed them by. No Empress before had ever left the court, and Getta didn't stop there. She wandered beyond the great gate, and down into the streets of the low-town. 
codex.777f361641d102b0bfb3d8744803f773=At the market, Getta was not in the least bewildered by the crowd that gathered around her. They were awed by her beautiful green dress, and knew at once that she must be the Empress of Ishgiru. One man plucked up enough courage to speak; \r\n\"Why are you here Empress?\" he said.\r\nTo which she replied, \"I am here to play, what games will you play?\" \r\nThe crowd whispered among themselves, and after some time, had found no answer to her question. \r\n\"Empress - for that is who you must be - we know of no games, for there is not time enough in the day for them,\" said a lady with a warty eyelid.\r\n\"Indeed,\" said another, with dirty bare feet, \"at dawn I see the animals are fed, in the morning I must make good their beds and groom their fur, at noon I sup bread and a sip water, in the afternoon I must cut their necks for slaughter, in the evening I must mind my own daughter. At night, I must sleep, for I'm tired.\"\r\n\"There is no time for play, and we are not disposed to it,\" rejoindered the warty lady.\r\nGetta seemed troubled. \r\n\"But life is play!\" she said, \"do you not dress up for me now?\"\r\nKnowing nothing of the world beyond the court, the Empress had mistaken their shabby apparel for a game. Why else would people wear such clothes?\r\n\"She must want a dress from the tailor,\" said one man excitedly, \"I'll fetch him here!\"
codex.65b48e707f6309ee0d6d846fe1eaedad=By now almost all of Ten-Rui had gathered in the square, fascinated by the mysterious visitor. From beneath an arch of hands the summoned tailor emerged, overjoyed to have such an illustrious patron.\r\n\"She has come for a new dress!\" chanted the crowd.\r\n\"I have come for a new dress!\" giggled the Empress.\r\n\"Come, my lady Empress, I will show you my wares,\" said the tailor.\r\n\"Of course!\" said Getta Renata believing, in her young mind, this to be a tradition afforded all young girls.\r\n\r\nThe crowd lifted the Empress high above them and carried her to the tailor's shop. They set her down at the quaint door, and she entered. The tailor closed the door on the hubbub behind her, so she could marvel in peace at the silks, quilts, cottons and linens. Every colour was there but green, for green was the courtly colour, and was permitted nowhere else.\r\n\r\n\"I will make something before your very eyes, Empress,\" bowed the tailor, \"will it be gold, lilac or seashell pink? Choose whatever your heart desires.\"\r\nGetta Renata looked about the shop, and her eyes fell immediately upon the work table where the tailor made his clothes.\r\n\"I'd like that brown one,\" she said, pointing to the tatty smock across it.\r\n\"What mean you?\" said the tailor, beside himself, \"that is not fit for an Empress.\"\r\n\"Why, it's perfect!\" she replied.\r\n\"But this is much too...large,\" he said, hoping to mislead her, \"what about this aquamarine and silver frock?\"\r\n\"No!\" she said crossly, \"I must have the brown one, then we can play together.\"\r\n\"Perhaps instead, I could have this whole shop sent to your father at the palace?\"\r\n\"The only costume I don't already have is that one,\" replied the little girl.
codex.51a6154f23d46faa534374941f2761e8=Reluctantly, the kindly tailor began work at the cheap brown material so that it matched the Empress' measurements. When he was finished, Getta changed her extravagant green dress for the simple brown smock.\r\n\r\nThe tailor knew when he opened the door, the waiting crowd would be angry. Sure enough they bellowed, \"An Empress cannot wear rags!\" \r\n\"But now we can play together,\" she said, and the crowd grew quiet again.\r\nAt that moment, her father appeared. Getta's mother, Empress Hamarafu, had died not long since, and the grief was still visible upon his face.\r\n\"Come daughter, this is not your place. The sparrows have been searching for you for hours. You must now return with me.\"\r\nThe Empress did not wish to upset her father any more, and returned to the court with him. 
codex.a40aec62e131e7a5745ba3d28ddafb3c=Many years passed and the Empress grew into a beautiful young woman. Alas her father did not live nearly as long. Three months after she had strayed from the palace, he fell ill and died in his sleep. With no firm hand to guide her, the Empress, who was a difficult child, became a yet more difficult adult. \r\n\r\nGetta Renata would oft leave the court, something her guardians had forbidden, and wander the streets of Ten-Rui. The people would always remember the little girl with the brown smock, and took fondly to her. She was flighty and hard to please, she asked questions and never waited for the answers, but none could deny that she was wise and kind, and had some special quality.\r\n\r\nShe always took time to visit the kindly tailor, and thank him for the smock he had given her. The tailor always offered her one of his beautiful dresses, and she always declined. As she grew, she asked him to adjust the smock so that it still fit her - but her guardians only ever allowed her to wear it in private. One day she visited his shop, only to find that it was closed and emptied. The tailor was sat on the doorstep crying.\r\n\r\n\"Oh poor Mr. Tailor\" she said, \"What has happened?\"\r\n\"I have been evicted by the squire, and dispossessed of  my wares,\" he said.\r\n\"Oh how terrible,\" said the Empress, \"I will see to it that you are restored.\"
codex.d26b7741d39f1dfa3b014b2cc33b3acd=That very moment, she rushed to her court, gathered her advisors, and asked that the squire be punished for his deplorable act. \r\n\"But these are ancient by-laws ma'am,\" replied the counsel of the purse, \"they are as old as the city itself.\"\r\n\"Then it is high time they were changed,\" she replied without ceremony, and she dismissed the counsel of the purse from his duties.\r\nAnd so the squire was forced to return the tailor's garments and materials, and the deeds to the building too. The tailor offered the princess his eternal gratitude. \"Should you ever need a whit, it would please me to do all in my modest power to bring you that which you desire.\"   \r\n\r\nThe Empress' rule was absolute. No past Empress had paid so little heed to her counsel. She did not merely inhabit her position, she rose to it - and soon a flood of new decrees were made. All folk would have at least an hour of leisure a day. All would have food if they wanted it. The rich would pay a levy to the needy, and a feast day at which all in Ten-Rui could revel was announced.
codex.2add8f42aa975cb15b0b6e07fda4ba82=But the Empress' fun had not gone unnoticed. A secret alliance was formed of those standing to lose by her reforms, led by her scorned counsel of the purse. He was worried about the poor rising up to corner their masters, and decided the Empress must be deposed before it was too late. \r\n\r\nHe concocted a clever scheme. One night, armed men kidnapped the Empress from her bed, and a courtier who was her mirror image, was snuck between the sheets. That very night, Getta Renata was taken by sea to the green islands, where she was imprisoned under the watch of a great and terrible dog, whom none could describe or speak of.\r\n\r\nThe courtier who had replaced the Empress made for an excellent ingenue, and began immediately to withdraw the laws Getta had sworn in, saying she had declared them too hastily. She addressed the populace from the court balcony, and stated that her decrees were naive flights of fancy not befitting an Empress. First there were murmurs, then grumbles, and by the time the false Empress had returned indoors, outright booing.
codex.a3a79a3ec5d27c0b6d677a2c92d3082a=Nevertheless the counsel of the purse insisted the young courtier disguised as the Empress continue to visit the low-town, just as Getta had done, so that no suspicions would be aroused. The courtier quickly discovered that the mood of the people had changed. The Empress, whom as a child in a brown smock they had so dearly loved, appeared to have betrayed them. \r\n\r\nNo sooner had the courtier, disguised in the Empress' beautiful green dress, entered the market square, than barrels were tipped, and rotten fruit thrown in her direction. Others took handfuls of mud and smeared her where she stood. The sparrow guard rushed to her defence, impaling the culprits with their spears, but the damage was already done. The mob now turned upon the guards, and the courtier was able to escape into a backstreet.
codex.35efb30e112c1ea36e888b3c8a9f0a77=The courtier immediately looked for new clothes to wear, for she could not wear the royal green so besmirched. Seeing the sign, she made at once for the tailor's shop. The tailor recognised her as the Empress Getta Renata, for the courtier's face was an excellent likeness, and he believed it was her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh hello, my Empress,\" said the tailor smiling, though not as warmly as was usual, for even he was disappointed she had reneged on her promises. \r\n\"I will make something before your very eyes, Empress,\" he bowed, \"will it be gold, lilac or seashell pink? May it be whatever your heart desires.\"  \r\n\r\nInstead of trying to imagine which garment Getta Renata would have chosen, the courtier allowed the wonder of the shop - for she had seen nothing as lively at the court - to bewilder her. Thinking that she was now Empress, and could indeed have whatever she desired, she tried on each and every dress in the shop, had them all sent to the court in exchange for gold.
codex.391c78fa348ae228ce0b251c949c3c79=Remarkably, the kindly tailor took her measurements, and found them to be exactly as they had always been. He took her instructions patiently, making all the arrangements she had asked for. When the courtier had exhausted him, and night was soon to fall, she turned her back on him and marched to the door to leave. \r\n\"Please wait your highness, for there is one more dress in my shop,\" he said, and he took a plain brown smock from the top of his work table and held it before her.\r\n\"Do you mock me sir?\" she said, \"that is not fit for an Empress, and is presently much too large.\"\r\n\"Very well,\" he said, smiling sadly. \r\nBut before she could step through the door to rejoin the sparrow guard, the tailor had a hold of her neck, and his sharpest needle over the ball of her eye.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the true Empress? I shall not make clothes for an impostor.\"\r\nShocked and afraid for her life, the young courtier spilled all she could about the great dog and the green islands, and vowed not to speak of his assault should he let her safely go. That he did, and the courtier ran off into the night, never to be seen again. \r\n\r\nThe next day, on the tailor's advice, the angry populace stormed the court and commandeered it for themselves. Though once they were there, they lacked the wherewithal to use their power. Meanwhile, the kindly tailor chartered a galleon in exchange for the gold he had been given for his clothes, and with his crew, set sail for the green islands.
codex.cb8a80cee0a44c7cd70add61114bb59a=When he arrived there, he immediately came upon the great dog, whose fur was also green. A hapless sailor tried to attack the dog with his cutlass, but the dog brushed him aside with a lazy paw, and he was dashed upon some rocks. Then the great dog spake.\r\n\"I know why you have come.\"\r\n\"I came because I must,\" replied the kindly tailor, \"for I made a solemn promise.\"\r\n\"Then I shall not stand in your way, provided you can answer three questions,\" the great dog boomed.\r\n\"Very well,\" said the tailor, who was determined in spite of his fear.\r\n\"One. What is your profession?\"\r\n\"I am a poor tailor, with not a penny to my name,\" he said, and he spake the truth, for he'd spent the last of his gold on chartering the galleon.\r\n\"Good,\" said the dog, chewing on a sailor's bones, \"Second. Who is it you seek?\"\r\n\"I seek the Empress of Ten-Rui, who has been imprisoned here against her will. She is a noble creature, yet she kind enough to pity the weak. Oh great dog, can you not learn to pity the weak too?\"\r\n\"I can,\" said the great dog, licking the blood from its paws. Then the dog asked the last of its questions, \"Third. What is the real reason for your seeking the Empress? Do you hope for some personal gain in this business?\"\r\n\"Yes I do,\" said the tailor honestly, \"for though my promise was enough to bring me to these strange islands, I realise I love the Empress, and wish her to be my wife.\"\r\n\"Good,\" said the dog, \"then you may have her.\"\r\nWith that the dog opened the Empress' cage, and she fell into the kindly tailor's arms. The dog let the happy couple depart, though he gobbled a couple more sailors by way of reward.
codex.37a5fd3122b624b8297c2ef062581738=On their return to Ishgiru, all were delighted and recognised Getta Renata as the one true Empress. The tailor reprised the story of her kidnap, and hearing of the treachery, the peasants who had commandeered the court volunteered it back to her without further complaint. They had, in any case, been at a loss as to what to do there. Back on the throne, the Empress reinstated some of her laws, though this time she was careful not to go too far. She promised herself never to visit the low-town again.\r\n\r\nThe counsel of the purse and his allies were arrested by the sparrow guard, and sentenced to imprisonment on the green islands, watched over day and night by the great dog. \r\nThere was joy and laughter through the streets of Ten-Rui, and when the Empress and the kindly tailor married, the tailor was appointed her counsel of the purse, and they all lived happily ever after.
codex.b0a35bcf94196e8a76703aa99f31bf2c=Exhibit 52. Travel writings c.1500, Translated from the original Verduban. Museum of Ascension, Momoros.\nThe buildings are geometrically neat and square in comparison to our own, and not unlike those in the Gallish style. Bandinian serfs can be seen in every part of Redusa, chamfering and chiselling the stone, which comes in by ship at the harbour. We have all heard tell of the watchman, a gigantic statue straddling the harbour gate. Sadly these reports are exaggerated, since not only has the greater part of its body long since sunk beneath the waves, leaving only two leg stumps, but sandstorms from the south have worn away any painted detail. While lush and overflowing with life, Sabor is burning hot.
codex.021968193fa5d4fac26512ea54fa4afc=After a long sea voyage we needed rest, and as it turned out, we were hospitably received. A mesmerising pair - a female, with a tall and lithe body, and a man whose biceps were bursting - sliced open the skin of a spotted wild-cat, which had been filled to bloating with wine, and I was given a small noggin with which to scoop my share. The dainty sweetmeats that followed were a triumph, though the Saborians themselves did not partake, for they take immense pride in the physical perfection of their bodies. Some underhand jokes were made vis-a-vis our \"chubbiness\" in comparison to most of the Saborians, to whom vanity is no crime. Nevertheless, it meant we were as well fed as any at the palace, since the thought we might be in anyway dissatisfied was terrifying to them. Our first night we found the bed linens to be feather-stuffed, just as at home, and the translator expressed how greatly the Saborians wanted us to feel welcome. We were offered bedside companions, and many of us took them.
codex.148cec7c864328907cfa46a09b1a8fda=The second day, it was too hot to be outside. We stayed in the cool and angular tower, and were regaled with tales of the hunt by a wise-speaker. He conjured images of great beasts and creatures lurking above and below ground. Ants the size of foxes who live only in darkness, a horse that peeled to life from the trunk of an ancient tree. But foremost, was the story of Minuras of Conos. No sooner had the wise-speaker begun it, than the Saborians became quiet and attentive. \r\nLong ago there was a terror known as the Windebeast, a spirit born entirely of cloud. The Windebeast terrorised the delta, and many innocents died in its stormy grasp. Minuras of Conos bravely decided he must slay it. He undertook the journey north to the Mount of Plenty, where it had its lair. He had heard that lightning would erupt from the Windebeast's fingers, and decided he must either be so fast as to dodge them, or else so well-protected as to endure them. Not being known for his speed, Minuras fashioned a gigantic shield twice his height and width, behind which he could conceal himself. On entering the cave, the Windebeast poured all its might into the storm, and even Minuras' clever shield was not enough to deflect the jolt. They say Minuras was found three days later, burned as if he had been on fire, but still alive. Minuras was pronounced a god himself, for in the effort to kill him, the Windebeast had fractured into a thousand eddies. I am told the plateau of the Mount of Plenty still whistles with its voice. \r\nThese sorts of stories continued throughout the day, as we enjoyed dried but succulent fruits.
codex.f45fce53b27f95c7f722417ac93e5c50=As night came, and the day's warmth remained, great leafy fans wafted cool air upon our party, and there was music, and a display of nude dancing by athletic girls and boys. Demeron was delirious with the wine and gaiety, and tried to join in. Our hosts took great offense, halting the performance directly and instructing guards to chaperon Demeron outside. Thereupon he was held at spear-point until we had muddled an apology. The embarrassing incident hung over us the following morning, and it seemed proper to escape the awkwardness of the palace. 
codex.ecb92c27e3267a76764ab1fb626ac8d4=We took a trip out along the river Saba toward the grand delta, where its tributaries fan out like palm fronds, easing toward the sea. This bay of north-west Sabor curves like a blade, or the new moon, and they call it \"the perfect crescent\", because its people have everything they desire.\r\n\r\nOur vessel was fine and stately. The sun beamed and shone, but a breeze took the edge off the heat. Small boats, filled with chickens, goats, fisherfolk and ferrymen, ran us by. Tombs and temples, in varying states of disrepair, specked the river banks, and we'd stop off at as many as could. Some contained undecipherable writings, and painted casks filled with the possessions of the dead. The Saborians claim that they were among the first civilisations, and having cruised along their delta, I have no reason to doubt it. These constructions appear very old indeed. I saw, for example, an obelisk commemorating a general at a battle waged long before the Bandinian war, itself nearly a thousand years ago.
codex.d97f3b1d3722efca11c35c46d1e3d7cc=One tomb in particular struck me. Stepping from the boat, and thanking our silent ferryman in gold, I saw a green conical artifice like a beehive or an acorn. This was immediately strange, as much of Redusa was drawn in rigid lines. The ubiquitous Bandini serfs were busying themselves at this sanctuary as at no other, yet it seemed we were its only visitors. \"But the weather is too good,\" said our guide by way of explanation. \r\nThe slaves scrubbed the stones and clipped the foliage so that all appeared neat and exact. A recent-laid and shining walkway led up to the tomb, bordered with precious stone and soft palms and spiny bushes native to the region. \r\n\r\nIt was pleasingly cool within, and a tiny rooflight let in a single beam which fell upon an inscription. It was carved in peculiar green stone. The rest of the building was bald but for these glyphs, which I was led to believe (by the disgraced but well-informed Demeron) referred to the practices of an ancient god Perima (there is a Peri-mo-la in the Gallish canon, although I fail to see a connection). It seems these writings must have some great resonance today, given the apparent significance of the tomb. The inscription also refers to a godly \"aetherium\", which served these ancients as an afterlife. In death, men were said to become gods, becoming part of a \"cloud-like\" communage, thereafter deciding in unison, the destiny of the world they had left behind.
codex.1a112bfaad6d2a3b17d3af7ab06a459e=We were informed that a number of people, including a well-known writer, are said to have vanished at this tomb. Witnesses say they evaporated into the air of a stormy night, which might explain why this place has lately become a sensation. A cult has formed, its acolytes intending to submit themselves to \"swallowing up,\" in the hope of a better life in the beyond. But only on the rare days of thunderstorms!\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that of all my journeys, the Saborians are the people seeming closest to gods. I saw no injustice in their land, where all children are born equal. I am so much enamoured, that I plan to return and apply for citizenship myself.
codex.3b07a9e818970f0d6a398c07aa5b3177=I scratch this dark wall panel with a piece of Atlas (call it a lucky charm). Jaz, who is a ruffian, finds this odd, but is happy to see a fool like me occupied and out of the way, and while it hurts to commit our recent history here, I feel there is no other place to begin. \r\n\r\nIf you are reading this now, I am delighted for you. Firstly, because you can clearly still read, and have therefore been schooled formally or informally. Secondly, because you are about to revel in our terrible past, all its happenings and disasters, without ever having to experience the horror firsthand. I hope you find some way of appreciating your good fortune in that regard. \r\n\r\nOur waterways became our skyways, and our ships, skyships. In many ways we are the same people we were thousands of years ago. Then Atlas happened, and many said it was a terrible thing. I tend to disagree, I say we ourselves are to blame, but I am hardly surprised that's what they said. Atlas was, after all, the beginning of the end for the old world. 
codex.3d8eeee81d5f4bca60b021efba36e2d4=Ah, the old world - it seems strange to baptise it thus. Though it has been months, it feels a matter of hours since Foundation was below us, all around us. The seething stinkpots that were Darat and Drissa, the sweet smell of Mellifluan goat musk, children playing by the impossible fountains of Ten-Rui. I wonder if those fountains are still out there somewhere, who knows?\n\nI should say, as I chew its softened blubber, that we didn't go hunting for the skywhale. It just happened out of the clouds and nearly split the deck in two. Its slimeshell weeped blackly right where the harpoon pierced it. Jaz says it was only young. He is a canny lad, and always has a harpoon ready. Sometimes, I wonder if he needs to clean and oil it as much as he does, but what do I know?
codex.fa59cb587733cb3e1eaf5f6197bec866=I long for a mug of good hot vittle, not this slop we have. I only visited the Korchis mountains once, but they brewed it so well. Chado nut-vittles, sweet yet bitter, dark and indulgent. Smokiness too. But heavens, I must stop drooling. \r\n\r\nJaz came in, but he's gone now. He was gruff with me, when they're like that I feel so alone. These aren't really my people, but what can I do? I hope they can't read what I've written, it might make things worse. I've had some bad moments, and Jaz is the only one speaking to me;\r\n\r\nI said, \"Jaz, what have I done?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"You're too noisy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"You eat too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we've a whole whale strapped across deck, and the ship struggles to stay afloat!\"\r\n\r\n\"We might never snare another,\" he said. \r\n\r\nI think I'm beginning to get it. It's not because I overeat, or am too noisy. It's not the difference in status between us - which has no significance in the frame of this new world. It is that they fear death, and I do not. They merely want to survive, but I want to live. Give me pleasure, let me love and let me dance! Though I have no legs, I still have feeling in my two arms. Let us not drift in this black turmoil having no fun at all!
codex.d6f4ab9054207d384284a309fa70896b=The storms are terrible, and we are trapped down in the hold, where the stench of whale oil makes me gag. I'm feeling well enough to write, since the others keep our spirits up. Jaz and Nomusa had a good laugh at my Pinnish hat, and I laughed along too. They were being cruel, but at least they are no longer ignoring me.\r\n\r\nI had no choice when it came to a ship. Ten-Rui was chaos when the rumbles burst the earth, and we pushed and shoved our way to the pierpoints like a warlock's rats (Oh, how I long to have the space and legs to run again). I took refuge in the first skyship I could, this tiny but robust wonder on which we now drift. \r\n\r\nThe captain, Joson, immediately complained of my presence. Joson said I was, \"the kind of useless buffoon that got us into this mess\". I panicked and said I would make a fine addition to their crew, being a respected aviation scholar, and that they would be wise to extend an expert pilot a welcoming hand. \r\n\r\nThen Joson and Jaz had a discussion in Pin, a language I do not profess to understand - something about a debt. As the skyship made away, the pair decided to continue this discussion above deck. An hour passed, after which only Jaz returned. I think Joson may somehow have perished, but Jaz has not spoken of it since.
codex.98e1c9453a3bc440fc099fdfe09b2c11=My lies caught up with me. When pressed by Jaz, who it seems has now inherited the captaincy, I was forced to admit that my competence in practical aviation was rather overshadowed by my knowledge of historic naval battles, specifically the feats of commander Alkabar of the Bandini. Jaz's disappointment manifested suddenly and painfully with a bop to my nose. \r\n\r\nJaz's fury cooled, and my nose recovered. I had hoped that with my secret out, they might come to accept me for who I was. As it is, we've travelled together for some time since, enduring many hardships, and yet I still feel that unless I find a way of contributing substantially, I shall suffer the same fate as poor Joson.
codex.b6522d439267512daf3c144d5936db44=Without the use of my legs, I despair. I have lost track of what's happening outside; all I need remember is that it is a place of darkness and violence. I feel discouraged by the way things have gone. Preserve, destroy, create, the Mellifluans call this chaos \"limbo\". Whatever it is, our tiny craft is at its mercy.\n\nMy perception of time seems to have inverted. I once heard a story about the Mellifluan many-gendered god Baliandri. The Mellifluans say Baliandri straddles the great beetle Motus, who faces the future, and puts his abdomen to the past. As mortals, we are the opposite. We do not know what lies ahead, we can only know what has been and gone.\n\nMy own past is like the foreboding entrance to a hedge maze. Its entrance pillars are aflame, and fire convulses over the threshold. Rajas circle ominously, waiting to strike. But courage flushes me, for I know what lies at the centre of the maze. A beautiful ornament. It is the eternal spring of life. A memory of the old world, and my sole companion in this, the new.
codex.b4089890d316c982bb58119a063bf986=The sky seems lighter today.\r\nJaz just came in, and he thinks I might finally be of some use to them. We have discovered land - I can see it through a porthole. There is a beautiful copse of autumnal trees, like a tiny piece of Karem floating on air. Nomusa, it seems, is nervous about what we might find. Being the most \"widely-traveled\" of the group, he hopes I can provide some sort of insight where they cannot. \r\n\r\n\"Well perhaps we can find fresh water there?\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"We have the rain-collector, we don't need water,\" Nomusa replies like a dictator. You know the type, one minute they look like they want to throw you overboard, the next you feel trapped.\r\n\r\n\"But I haven't had a good long slug in two years!\" I say. You see, we only ever seem to collect enough to get by. \r\n\r\n\"Fine, but food is more important. Don't go roving about, old man.\"\r\n\r\nNomusa is something of a navigator, and as long as the ship can be safely maneuvered, he is content. He obsesses over the ship, and we are all glad of that, but there's no enthusiasm saved for anything else. I have on many occasions, tried to stir up memories of their old lives and to hear their stories, but it is as though they have already forgotten them. Is it that these present hardships are no worse than the lives they already knew?
codex.976026b0b33cf9204b24bf06ba3f794d=We thought the terrors had passed, and perhaps they have. But foreboding omens still remain. I woke sharply around midnight. The ship was dark, but I heard a commotion up on deck. Jaz swayed as he held a lantern and yelled into the storm. The portholes swung open and shut on their hinges.\r\n\r\nMy senses did not quicken to the trouble until I looked to the cloud. It plumed to the heavens like a great green bust. From beyond it came a dark speck; a ship, and lightning flanked her, as she sailed towards us. Jaz managed to get a burst from the engines, and we pillowed upward, no longer obstructing her path, as she skirred mournfully, and in silence, beneath us. \r\n\r\nSomething about the galleon caught in my throat. I threw myself up the forecastle stairs, and clawed open the door into the howl, before knuckling across the deck on my stumps, hoping to catch another glimpse. \r\n\r\nSure enough she loomed up; her blackened hull and rotten sails. No crew could have lifted such a curse as she'd invoked. Her twisted bony beams, creaking and straining. Swirls of darkness in her wake, like the bloom of poison ink. Then the ship folded in on itself before my very eyes. Vanished, I swear. I'd say she was a dream, or mirage, but for the sickly smog of snuffed incense that lingered long after.
codex.42d476173df1495a5b290fac2216003c=Together, we survived another attack. I am told it was the helmsman's fault, and that out of curiosity he had steered us towards a flight of birds. Drawing near, we saw not birds, but beetles. Their vibrant elytra were a warning, like Godhand livery at the gates of Momoros. They hubbubbed and flickered at us, and we were obliged to beat them away with sticks, until we could manoeuvre clear. \r\n\r\nIf only, in those first few days, we'd been able to outrun the Gizzard so easily, I'd still have me legs. Those brigands toyed with me as I hung from the mizzenmast. All my juices drained into my stockings, and the days came in and out of view with thirst. It was not before time that Jaz broke us free, and singing an old warlock's song, set the knaves asleep. He took possession of their engines, and left them to drift, and we were all the better for it. My legs suffered some horrible putrefaction, and heavily medicated, Nomusa swiped them off with a blade.\r\n\r\nI suppose the misfortune of losing my legs is offset against the good fortune of still being alive. Gods bless Jaz and his crew for their resourcefulness, I hope in time I can repay them.
codex.399bd30b77ef505dc5d71df832526128=I sat with Jaz and the others at the captain's table. We had some good crab. I have now been given an official title - I shall be Bo'son. I believe however, that this is wit on the part of my fellow skyfarers, given that no such position is required on a ship without sails. Still it is their way of including me, and I am glad.\r\n\r\nImagine two bulls, churning the mud. They fight at the expense of all else, eyes crazed, their bodies rent and broken. Yet they are perfectly matched, and neither will back down over the heifer they most desire. That is how it was at the end. That is how Foundation fell.
codex.393b2561e41dc45e760e2d7f5f12c6e0=If you want to lay blame at a door, it must be at Sabor's. I remember Redusa before the end of the second millennium, it was dazzling, perfect, untroubled. But as the floor rocked, others were made to suffer to keep that bubble from bursting. They wanted Atlas, but from where? First Bandinia, then Melliflua. If the Saborians had known the way it would end, would they have stopped sooner, before it was too late? How a peoples can be both so selfless and so selfish, we may never know. \r\n\r\nBut my people played their part, there's no doubt. They had peace, but wouldn't take it. The Empress was rational in her madness, and at her shoulder, was Gloam, mad in his rationale.
codex.e61d4d80ff45856840e2e4b0c6d7a777=I hereby ascribe the year I commenced writing these histories the \"new days\". We begin, not at the old beginning, but the new one. A new beginning. \r\n\r\nToday is the first day the skies have been clear in seven years. We hoped and hoped, and now we rejoice. That terrible empurpled hole, the belly of a beast, is satisfied, and the creature retires to its cave to brood.    \r\n\r\nI am on the lower deck, and am blissfully nibbling chunks of stewed skywhale. It is from here that I can look comfortably out through the portholes of this heroic ship. Oh how I love it! How I love its crew tenderly. This is a love expressed by our very survival, by us withstanding so many tribulations. Yet here we all still are, and as I watch pink clouds wisp by, I take pleasure in every second, that I, Tomalayo, am able to continue my life.\r\n\r\nI have finally gotten hold of pen and linen! Not since my days at the court! In time I hope to transfer these ramblings from the wall, for whomever might find them - to be kept in a museum perhaps, when the new days rebuild us. But every minute, every hour, every day, takes us further away from what we were. Like a boat heading out to sea, we might one day look back, and seeing no shoreline, forget ourselves. I feel it is my duty, in these notes, to recount the world as it once was. 
codex.ba86740a740623f3f7ba6b220128ba91=You know, these whales are strange, but they don't scare me. Dad used to trap them when I was a boy, before we moved away from Tarrery. Very cold, was Tarrery, and yet we never wore many clothes! No, these whales don't scare me. Not if you know how it was in Ten-Rui when the towers fell. \r\n\r\nIf I squint at this beautiful sunset - a forgotten pleasure - do not take it for granted! - then I still see its black silhouette. The spry, arched back. The weave of arcane sinew. A barnacled hoop of encrustation, and the very same the Pekoe said would come. Hatep, come to gather his children. A demon or a god, I'm sure of it. Jaz denies these memories exist. He says we saw many queer things, and have no marker for what was and wasn't real.
codex.06869d041530656cbf19fdeb62065155=He brings me a jug of water. A whole jug! Jaz is smiling. Through a porthole, I can see the ripple of the lake from which it was drawn. Nomusa meanwhile, has been lancing crustacea all day. He prowls, and I can see him asking the others to get back aboard in order for us to leave. Now I'm not for a moment suggesting we spend our whole lives on this tiny isle, but can we at least investigate a little? If they could lift me, I could move around on my hands and stumps. Looking for some good bits of pegwood to remedy my situation. 
codex.aeb6abfb0d8443b149c849fbb484c359=They say Telemon had no friends, but nor did he have enemies. His charm and bluster saw to that. I heard, whenever the Assembly met at the Stalk, he threw lavish suppers garnished with gold leaf and powdered Atlas. What an ungodly hypocrite, but the wheels were slipping by then. \r\nNear the end, it was rumoured he had a tumpkin like a ship's hull, and had lost all the hair on his head. Of course he couldn't let them see him like that. The public speeches had to stop, and he spoke over the radio instead.
codex.513fbc24f9a0e6d33f16f6d6a8423094=Many islands we've encountered have been green, but drearily small and unremarkable. The latest, however, was different. I found a largely intact ruin of Panyana University. The cobbles and the arches mind, no books, no students. \r\nI've no doubt they thought it'd last forever. Maybe it will in some form. But they can't have imagined vines creeping the pews, and lectures led by beetles and flies. \r\nTime and nature persist even if we are broken. Us, scattered like fragments of a jar, whose oil has spilled through cracks in the floor.\r\n\r\nThe Gall were the subtle menace, like a leaf blowing in the wind, to whichever\r\nopportunity paid dividend. It is unfortunate none could decrypt their Rebus, else the black isle might have fallen, and the full catalogue of their knowledge have been freely available to all. Or would that have made things worse? I don't suppose it matters anymore.
codex.ed32d5e5833d2dc79afa27b9e44cb656=If you are reading this, perhaps I have found a wife, and you are my kin. Foundation is no more, yet this skyblown archipelago demands a fresh start of us. There are few of us left, and we must endeavour to bring it dignity.\r\n\r\nI am laying my pen to rest, for there is work to be done. I am helping to build a small fixed house, where myself, Jaz and Nomusa can live. Yes, I know, unlikely bedfellows we may seem, but I have garnered some respect when it comes to practical things. \r\n\r\nI tire of the endless search, and wish to take to the air when I please, not by necessity. We have found a large and fine island. Let us hope no other terrors await us there. We men shall then raise a great beacon, like mythical sirens, so that passing beauties can be lured into our trap!
codex.1a796494e99bceca3c2e96683408d71b=I'm leaving this bulletin as a warning to any other traders that come through the western pass. It's just not worth it anymore. The place is infested with those pissing Marauders. They've clearly been watching our routes, there's a ship filled to the brim with those slug-eating bastards hiding underneath every island, just waiting for a ship to pass by. We had to redline the engines the whole journey to get past them. All I can say is I'm really glad we upgraded our engines last week.\r\n\r\nWe're going to have to spend everything we earn selling our cargo repairing the damage done to our ship, it didn't help that we had to ditch half of it to maintain our speed to escape. I'm absolutely livid. These Marauders are complete animals. It's a disgrace that no-one has done anything about them yet. \r\n\r\nI'm going to switch to the route via the old seaport, rumour has it there aren't so many of them there, and I suggest you do the same.
codex.6bc193ea3e3a0dc31505e55e82bd6ffd=Hi all,\n\nOnce again I'm sorry about the events of last night. If I had known that we were going to be hosting Clot and his gang I never would have let them on board. You can all rest assured that we will be distributing pictures of the key offenders amongst the staff for future reference. None of them are welcome in our establishment in the future!\n\nSpeaking of the future, now we need to pull together to fix this mess. The first thing we need to do is clean up obviously. I've actually left to buy more mops. I'll be back in a few hours. There's about 3 gallons of rum soaking into the floorboards as we speak, and one of Clot's boys smashed our mop over the head of one of his friends.
codex.84660931448db8ff429aa8179adae944=I don't know where they found all that paint, but the back room has some obscene language painted on it. Jack, would you be able to mix up some paint cleaner so we can start to get that cleaned off?\n\nI'm going to be heading off to get replacements for the furniture. I think I managed to keep 2 chairs and a stool from being destroyed last night so we'll need some replacements. If the rest of you can clear out all the pieces while I'm gone, some of it should be good for firewood, but I imagine a lot of it will be too heavily soiled.
codex.26fdaaf475afaa542eee61fda59405dc=Lauren, would you be able to buy in some more kegs? We're not supposed to get new stock in for another 2 weeks but they ran us dry last night. The good news is they paid for their drinks for mosts of the night. The bad news is they stole back about half of what they spent on the way out. Perhaps unsurprisingly they ate all of our steaks, but there's still plenty of fruit left. \r\n\r\nA few of the guys brought that disgusting slug sauce with them, make sure you check for any that they've dropped under the table or between the decking, that stuff starts to stink pretty quickly. I actually found some inside the Atlas Core, and a couple of the engines. I have no idea how it got in there. It looks like someone smashed it in there, so I suppose that's probably what happened. We might have to disassemble some of the components to double check later.
codex.2aa0392867e09a67c64980f1e5fd0a7d=Hamish, you might need to sand down the bar to get the teeth marks out.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for everyone who got burned clothes last night. I've ordered in some flame resistant uniforms so it shouldn't happen again. Susan, I'm sorry about your hair. I don't think there's a lot we can do about that.\r\n\r\nThanks for sticking with me everyone, we'll have this restaurant ship back in business in no time at all. It'll be like none of this ever happened.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\tLincoln
codex.29d8dbf9a9008ed619c2d87686eda789=My dearest Violet, \r\n\r\nYour eyes are like pearls, your hair is like silk. You remind me of a painting by the old masters. I cannot bear another day without you.\r\n\r\nWhen can we meet again? Our last encounter was truly beauteous. I remember the way you looked at me when I handed over my satchel. I can't be the only one who felt that connection. Was it true love?\r\n\r\nI hope these are getting to you, I haven't had replies for my previous letters.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to hearing back from you my sweet,\r\n\r\nYours with deepest affection,\r\n\tDaniel Rousseau

codex.f54852b13da9fb0133e4456fec211b2a=To Violet,\r\n\r\nI'm not really used to writing letters... like this one, but in this situation I think I have to. I think I was a little too timid when we met a few weeks back, I doubt I made much of an impression. \r\n\r\nYou and your crew made a pitstop on and island which I happened to be on. I'd hidden my ship underneath the island and climbed up, looking for more fuel. I believe your crew were looking for some metal to make some quick repairs, it looked like you'd been in a bit of a skirmish.\r\n\r\nI stayed out of sight by ducking under some bushes, but I did manage to get some great photos of you while I waited. There's something magnetic about the way that you look. I couldn't help myself. I think you spotted me as you were leaving as you ordered your men to destroy my ship, stranding me on the island. That's fair, I probably had that coming.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm writing this because... Well I think I love you. I've never felt like this before. I've included a... personal photo for you. Hopefully that will convince you that I'm a man worth meeting properly.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\tThe Mighty Crum 
codex.384a150b84064a928a493636b0c335d4=Violet,\r\n\r\nA violet is a kind of flower isn't it? That's apt because you are beautiful, smell amazing, and attract swarms of buzzing insects eager to get a taste of you. Do you ever get annoyed with the insects? I could take care of that for you. If you let me, I could be the swatter that crushes the insects. I'll be your swatter.\r\n\r\nI've swatted many insects in my time, Violet. I don't know if this metaphor is working or not. When I'm talking about insects I mean people. I've killed a lot of people. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm offering to do is murder people who try to get close to you.\r\n\r\nOK let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\tCinderhead
codex.e21ddd69bd1e0eff2272c418842477a0=Hey Violet,\r\n\r\nIt's me, Drake. I just wanted to thank you for the other night. I've never met a woman quite like you. I'm just writing because you did mention you'd be in touch as you left in the morning but I haven't heard from you yet. Hoping that you've just lost my contact information or... forgotten my name or something.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to see you again, I think we had a real connection. Anyway, if you don't want to send a letter I'll be hanging out in the Bobcat tavern by the North Lanes as usual, swing by if you can!\r\n\r\nGreat, thanks, hope to hear from you soon,\r\n\tCaptain Bridger

codex.a5343bfcb7a021bb05097a012d75212d=My god you should have seen her. Pure grace personified. The way she swings is like nothing I've ever seen. Effortless. Effervescent even. I'm not sure I'm using that right. I'm convinced she could shoot a gnat off of a Manta's shoulder from half a mile away. I think the moment I saw her in action things changed for me. \r\n\r\nI had booked a vessel to ferry me through the Badlands. I could have gone the long way round but it would have taken me longer. I hired a group of swarthy looking gentlemen with a fair amount of experience fighting rapscallions, they assured me I and my cargo would be entirely safe. They weren't prepared for what awaited them!
codex.ab7271d08b8e393d94dc28ca5211b9ca=The Marauders have a reputation for being brutish, but Violet's gang are anything but. Yes they'll murder you in a heartbeat, but they'll do it with such panache. They landed on the ship in perfect unison and swiftly rendered my retinue unconscious with minimal fuss. \r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon sir\" said the first with a smile. \r\n\r\n\"Would you be able to show us to the cargo please?\"\r\n\r\nI thought briefly about putting up some resistance, but decided it was unwise. I was enraptured by this dashing posse.\r\n\r\n\"Of course! May I ask who I am dealing with?\"\r\n\r\nThat's when she stepped up, past the gentleman with the magnificent moustache.\r\n\r\n\"I am Violet, and these are the finest members of my gang.\"\r\n\r\nShe speaks with a beautiful, exotic accent. I still can't quite place it.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind we're going to take a look around. Perhaps you know the way to the more valuable contents of this ship?\" She said.
codex.a7f038464a14f9dca55ceb94c94edfcd=Such cordiality! I immediately took them down into the interior and showed them the way to my belongings. As they were digging through my jewellery a thought occurred to me.\r\n\r\n\"There's more where that came from you know\" I offered.\r\n\r\nViolet looked up from the containers and locked eyes with me. Eye contact. What a delight. Such beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" she asked simply.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to join you and I'll take you there\" I gulped.\r\n\r\nViolet flashed me a wry smile and I swear my heart flipped in my chest.
codex.f8228b45901173f95a87fc5a454dd4d8=The next few weeks were spectacular. I flew side by side with Violet, selling out all my old friends one by one for whatever they had. Watching her in motion every time she brought a ship down, sometimes single handedly, is a fonder memory for me than the birth of my son. I suppose that sounds heartless but believe me when I tell you that woman is a work of art.\r\n\r\nOnce we'd squeezed all my old friends dry and I had nothing left to offer I had hoped Violet would keep me on, perhaps as a mascot or a companion, but alas she is far too intelligent to indulge such foolishness. They dropped me off on some cursed rock in the middle of nowhere, where I remained for quite some time before being found by a passing merchant. 
codex.2001101bc849955c80cfcfb8acaf320b=I attempted to regale him with stories of my adventures but he didn't seem particularly impressed. He kept asking me about how my friends were and why I sold them out. Perhaps Violet's charm is impossible to convey accurately in the spoken word? My wife certainly doesn't seem to understand, in fact she seems quite upset when I talk about my adventures.\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm writing this letter, in fact. I've heard that you've managed to salvage an old printing press from some island. I believe that the only way for me to do justice to these events and to Violet is to write and publish a book about it. I know that good ink and paper is scarce, and I must admit that I am rather low on funds these days, but perhaps you can lend me a little for old times sakes? Just to get up and running?\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing back from you,\r\n\tYours truly, Howard Jaques
codex.f2d4345b1d04c9f60206ae1896033a2e=Vicious attack of the western collective. Some signs of burning but not enough to warrant a fire crew. 10 confirmed dead, 32 injured. \r\n\r\nThe gang fled to the east, 2 crews in pursuit aprox 6 hours ago. No update yet. Gang ship has broad, squat frame, red paint. Panels are mainly steel with some makeshift replacements in elm and iron. Mid tier turbine engines. Expect minor damage to left engines and rear wings.\r\n\r\nGang is thought to be some of Clot's men or similar. The smell is noticeable from some distance. \r\n\r\nAdvise caution if approaching.
codex.b5d6497e52d1da192b56b998e5d279d6=Light cosmetic damage to merchant ship north north west. Some cleanup of Marauder components wouldn't go amiss. Seems like they bit of more than they could chew. \r\n\r\nMarauders fled to the south. Heavy damage to gang ship is expected. Reports suggest the Marauder ship took 7 or 8 high powered cannon shots to the engines. At least 3 engines have been confirmed destroyed. Remaining panels are mostly oak or elm, with two or three made from iron. Could be they're out of fuel by now as they lost a fuel tank in the skirmish.\r\n\r\nGang isn't thought to be affiliated with any of the major bosses. Should be a straightforward encounter.
codex.b1f0d83a25b1d8c25899f01f439fc046=Ambush of pursuit crew north north west. Team were lured into trap when in pursuit of a minor vessel. One survivor.\r\n\r\nSurvivor managed to escape by lowering herself to a nearby island and hiding. Once Marauders were done stripping the pursuit ship they were seen leaving to the east. The gang used two heavily armed, lightweight vessels which hid in dense fog until the pursuit crew boarded a damaged Marauder ship which turned out to be deserted. The attack was swift and relentless.\r\n\r\nOur leads on their location are tenuous but tracking down this gang is of a high priority.
codex.a799f699a8f346843ed1b21ce421c9da=Reports suggest a large Marauder vessel is patrolling the central district searching for weaker vessels to attack. Previous attempts to approach haven't been successful as they flee as soon as they spot a ship capable of damaging them.\r\n\r\nSuggest we mount a co-ordinated attack from all directions. We need 4 mid-sized crews to pull this off. Do not approach the vessel until all others are in place. \r\n\r\nWe believe this particular crew is the gunship of one of the minor gang bosses, Maggie. She has a reputation for playing underhanded tricks, so don't be fooled by her. It's believed that the vessel had concealed swivel guns behind the helm.
codex.ffebd1fb6a30f943e03964d1948dec23=Hit and run on Marauder Hunter flagship. 30% of engines are destroyed and significant casualties on both sides. Marauders came in force, 6 fast gunships emerged from the storm walls and attacked at once.\r\n\r\nExpectation is the attack force is regrouping and making repairs. All nearby ships should pursue while they are weakened. \r\n\r\nProceed with extreme caution, these Marauder ships are fast and their cannons are powerful.\r\n\r\nRecommend larger ships proceed first until some of the cannons are disabled then remaining forces to come later to finish the job.
codex.01440f5193a5395172f016ec25707366=Big skirmish in the western pass. Looks like it was only Marauder ships involved this time. Must have been some kind of disagreement between them. Whatever it was it's a mess.\r\n\r\nNot sure how many ships were involved in total, but by the looks of the wreckage there are at least 5 ships that got destroyed, probably at least 2 more that took heavy damage but evidence suggests they were able to fly away from the scene. Possible that they are downed in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nWe don't foresee any danger here, no evidence of survivors, but we should keep an eye out for traps when we go in to salvage.\r\n
codex.fafa5dec69873ff07ae6f6fbddd644e5=Violet\r\n\r\nI came across some of your handiwork the other day. You left a lot of good gear for us, which I appreciate. Always makes me laugh how you turn your nose up at perfectly good food. If you prepare it right the stuff that grows in pantries is just as good as the stuff stored in them!\r\n\r\nI don't think I'll ever understand what the point of taking a ship down so... delicately is. My boys always break everything. And I'm sure you've seen what happens when Maggot's men are done with a ship. Nothing delicate about that...  If it weren't for the thick smell of perfume I wouldn't have known you'd even been there!\r\n\r\nAnyway, smell you later! \r\n\r\nHAHAHA\r\n\r\nLove from Clot
codex.2814381eeae2792e43ccb68a1cfe2ed2=Hello Clot.\r\n\r\nI received your letter. Thank you so much for sending it. I was able to read almost half of it. Your handwriting has actually improved a great deal, but unfortunately there was the faintest whiff of you left on the parchment and that kept making my eyes water. Perhaps I should send you some of my perfume?\r\n\r\nNext time we see each other I'll let you fish through my latrine in search of food if you like? You might find some of those slugs you like too.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nViolet
codex.eccf077c7ab79c361b1bedafbe353c50=Worms.\r\n\r\nI hope you are ready to submit to my rule. You are weak. I am strong. Under me we will rule the world.\r\n\r\nMaggot
codex.2a943810bde09b1c6c6a23b449b2b6a4=Violet\r\n\r\nDid you get that letter from Maggot? Always good for a laugh eh? \r\n\r\nKinda big though huh? I met him the other week and he's definitely got some stage presence. Weird how his boys always wear those masks. That's gotta be warm underneath.\r\n\r\nI'm going after some big game next week, there's a big 'ol convoy down west with some good gear and we have a mole on board. There's a lot of haul to be had but we could use the help to take them down. Or at least your guys can turn up with those flashy scarves and draw their attention while we do the real work. \r\n\r\nDon't tell him I said that.\r\n\r\nClot
codex.c428c75c1a1c2900026119d85cecd3d5=Greetings Clot,\r\n\r\nI'm flattered you thought of me for your escapade. I'm not sure we're going to be available as we're busy all of next week. I've also sent you a red scarf or two which you can put on your own men. I'm sure they'll do just as good a job distracting your opponents while you blunder your way through your half cocked plan and break everything.\r\n\r\nYes I did get the letter from Maggot. He's definitely delusional if he thinks that any of my guys would join up with him. Have you seen the conditions on his ships? It is rank. Absolutely horrendous. I suppose you might be OK with him, at least you'd get plenty of slug sauce.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nViolet
codex.d8732c78643617b59285e040827deb6a=Hi Violet,\r\n\r\nHa ha. Very funny. We didn't need your help anyway. That convoy didn't know what hit it. They had some beefy defenses but they were no match for us! We ended up hooking up with a couple of the smaller gangs to boost our firepower. Cinderhead was asking after you, apparently he's been sending you letters?\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of ships who came in and tried to take us down mid way through the attack. It was amazing! They called themselves \"Marauder Hunters\", which is a laugh. Most of 'em got thrown overboard, but we've got one of them in the \"brig\". By brig I mean a cupboard.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is just a quick heads up. Seems like there are a few crews trying to band together to \"hunt\" us. So that'll be exciting.\r\n\r\nAnyway, speak soon. Don't get lost in your scarf closet.\r\n\r\nLove from Clot
codex.188b20dad269359d5ffde223964c15a3=Hello Clot.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear your raid went well. Just knowing that Cinderhead was there is enough to convince me that I made the correct choice in not joining you.\r\n\r\nI have also encountered one of these self proclaimed Marauder Hunters. He joined up with my gang last week and made an attempt on my life during the night. Obviously he was not successful. Perhaps you can ask your pet hunter where we can find the rest of his ilk so we can neutralize the problem?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nViolet
codex.1935447d1b9382022c616c8f631fd05d=Violet,\r\n\r\nI had a few \"words\" with our \"guest\" but I wasn't able to get anything good out of him. These guys reckon that the skies are \"infested with scum\". I guess that's us? He spat in my face six or seven times. I do like his spirit. I guess if we had another go around he and I could get on OK.\r\n\r\nAnyway, he seems pretty confident that our days are numbered. Anyway, I put him in a cannon and fired him into a storm wall. \r\n\r\nLove from Clot
codex.21c82313decc8753abafe551ddb9f7f4=Dearest Clot,\r\n\r\nA few more of those Hunters arrived at one of our raids the other day, which was a nuisance at first, but eventually there were enough of them so that we actually had to abandon our target. This isn't a joke anymore. \r\n\r\nMaybe I should try your approach and fire some of these wretches into large weather phenomena.\r\n\r\nI'm not impressed.\r\n\r\nViolet.
codex.d8e28f9257b5aff0c70365439d73d8fb=Worms.\r\n\r\nI hear there are people planning to kill us. Join me and I will protect you. My strength will defeat all enemies. I will not kill you.\r\n\r\nMaggot.
codex.49b4e6cd9f143a0d7a3b3415eac5d83d=Maggot.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to live on one of your weird ships. Please stop asking. \r\n\r\nHave you been dealing with the Marauder Hunters too then? What do you know about them? Clot and I have been discussing them.\r\n\r\nI know you're capable of sending a comprehensible reply to this letter. Don't disappoint me, Maggot. You're a perfectly eloquent guy.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nVIolet.
codex.618540dc0ccd9d79fc5cb50913f3f7c9=Worm.\r\n\r\nI understand that you are afraid of the little men and you want Maggot to tell you some gentle things to make you feel safe.\r\n\r\nThere is no safety except on my ships. Join me and we will crush these little men. \r\n\r\nEvery few days a new little man who spends too long polishing his ship comes and tries to kill me. Every time they regret it.\r\n\r\nMaggot.
codex.ed3e47dd78286dcb5743838223721b1a=Clot,\r\n\r\nMaggot is a fool. I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him about what he knows but I don't think he'd be contacting us if he didn't know anything.I'm planning to meet with him in the next few days. I'm dreading it a bit but needs must. \r\n\r\nWe might be able to work together temporarily to crush these hunters so we can get back to our business in peace. I have a plan, and I'm hoping Maggot will listen. I know how much he hates listening, but maybe I can convince him that he thought of it.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nViolet
codex.703916ad741b066aeb55ff3a7c3dcd0e=Maggot,\r\n\r\nA crew of hunters came out of nowhere and started messing my ship up today. I actually had to abandon ship in the end. What a mess. Those curs swarmed my ship. There were a lot of them and they came all at once.\r\n\r\nWe snuck out of the back window and a few of us boarded one of their ships to see if we could get some info on them. We didn't get to see much before we got spotted but it looks like their actual target is you. They've been charting your course over a really long period.\r\n\r\nI don't really care about you, but if something happens to Violet I'm going to find you and kill you. \r\n\r\nClot
codex.88f48a2b7ebfafa917c78826c44c0aa2=Clot.\r\n\r\nI am not afraid of these small men. How embarrassing that they took your ship.\r\n\r\nViolet is here and she is safe. I have had an excellent plan. We are going to crush these men. Do not worry about us. I will not reply to your messages until the crushing is complete.\r\n\r\nMaggot
codex.40082d54b7ef5a07293210379cb9d8f6=Hey Maggot.\n\nI'm writing to you from hiding. I'm hearing a lot of rumours about what happened when you tried to \"crush\" the hunters. It doesn't sound like it went quite according to plan, did you guys make it?\n\nClot
codex.7529f91de4a5005cb0c3ba13d48c41ce=Hello Clot,\r\n\r\nMaggot is dead. His men are in a blood rage. We are going to attack the hunter fleet all together. I'm struggling to organize them.\r\n\r\nThis will probably be my last letter to you, and you probably shouldn't send any more to me. If we make it I think we should lay low for a while.\r\n\r\nSmell you later.\r\n\r\nViolet
codex.e7aa0ff8acd1a5d5f1ad4aae6865a02c=My Dearest Maggie,\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for not writing to you sooner, Violets newest boyfriend decided to steal all my writing things and hide them. It was all in good fun though, I'm sure! I miss you so much, it feels like it's been a thousand sunrises since I last saw you... I hope you're doing well. \r\n\r\nIts jolly good fun being a marauder! Last week we raided some fancy schamncy merchant vessel. It was amazing - there was a proper gunfight and everything! I didn't get to see it of course, but I could hear it all from the kitchen sink. \r\n\r\nI wish I could show you some of the things I've seen, it really is quite fantastic. Next time I write to you, I'll include some more money. \r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nHobbert
codex.274e9f48de306e9ed1feec1e6b32b1fe=My Sweet Maggie,\r\n\r\nIt breaks my heart to know you're upset with me - I promise with the next letter I'll send you more money. It's just been a little bit difficult lately. The lads are all quite boisterous - sometimes they'll steal my things as a joke or they won't give me my share. It's all a joke of course, but it can take a long time for them to give it back. I'm sure I'll get my fair share returned to me any day now, my love. \r\n\r\nViolet told me that we need to be extra careful lately as there's been rumours of some kind of Marauder hunters around. Hah! Those fools don't know what they're up against - I can't wait to make them taste the cold steel and gunpowder of the great dread pirate Hobbert!\r\n\r\nOh, and great news - I'll be in your area soon! I'm sure you'll be just as excited to see me as I am to see you.\r\n\r\nSee you soon, my dear.\r\n\r\nForever yours,\r\n\r\nHobbert 
codex.5a145bac29c9440f62b6276d7083e77d=My Darling Maggie,\r\n\r\nIt was very unfortunate that you came down with manta-mumps when I came back to visit, but your new helmsman was very kind and made me tea and assured me you'd be back on your feet soon. It was a terrible shame that it's so infectious, but I've included some herbs that should help you feel better. Also, I don't remember you saying you got a new helmsman?  He seemed of the reliable and handsome sort, very handsome - I hope he treats you kindly. You deserve nothing but the best for your crew!\r\n\r\nTomorrow we go on a raid of the remains some famous Atlas Engineering School. They say they were slowly unravelling the secrets of the Atlas cores. Not that Violet and the boys seem to care though. They're more interested in the rumour of some hidden treasure in the school grounds. Of course, another crew has their eyes on it too, so it's likely to be a bloody mission! \r\n\r\nAnyway, it's finally a chance for me to show what I've got! They've appointed me as Chief Fodder, and given me a very nice new gun. I'm not too sure what being Chief Fodder means, but I'm excited to be going on such a dangerous and prestigious mission. I'm glad they're finally taking me seriously! When you first had me transferred to Violets crew, I was worried you were getting rid of me, but now I see you just wanted to give me my chance at the spotlight! \r\n\r\nI'll see you after the battle!\r\n\r\nYours bravely,\r\n\r\nHobbert

Angus is not an unreasonable sort, perhaps next time you could simply ask for some rum? Never the less, we must be sure to meet as soon as is possible! My crew will be leaving in short order for the expanse - we've heard rumour of a potential location for Maggot's secret treasure! It's an incredible opportunity for us to snatch a few crumbs of what is rightfully ours!\r\n\r\nAs for the rumours of what happened to the last crew - I'm sure theres no meat to it! A bit of friendly competition never hurt anyone. Besides, we're all Maruaders, we're all blood... there is no way I could conceed he'd do such a thing. Certainly not given that at least half of his stash is supposed to be our leaders anyway!

Angus was correct - I am the only one who survived our expedition. The location of the treasure was a trap, set by a traitor amongst our own. The Bloodclaw Marauders are no more. Kara betrayed us, having fallen in love with Maggot (what is it about that brute that people find so compelling?) and seeking to win his approval, she set us all up!\r\n\r\nI was able to survive his cruelty, but not intact. He took my writing arm, my eyes and my tongue, but thankfully I was found by another crew who saved my life. It took me a while to recover enough, but the skies were kind to me and I am my old self again, mostly.

codex.4f9e65e76120a8480ecb1a861bb0e397=Due to the recent string of marauder attacks in the area, we've decided to collect everything we know about them in the hopes of helping others survive. \r\n\r\nStep one is to identify the leader - depending on which gang is attacking, it might be possible to avoid casualties altogether. Here are some eye witness descriptions and testimonies that we've managed to put together. Your odds of survival depend on who is attacking: 
codex.1805bf1dd466501213896412e72aa21a=Smells like spoiled milk and vomit, terrible facial hair, short, drunk, covered in mysterious stains: Clot, or one of Clots gang. Clot is the least dangerous of the marauders, although he has a terrible temper and his gang is known for violent, over the top vandalism and property damage. Most of the time, his gang is less \"attacking\" and more \"looking for alcohol\". He can often be bribed into leaving somewhat peacefully with a few barrels of rum. Be aware though, that any comments about his height or \"magnificent beard\" will result in a repeat of the incident at ol' Carlen's restaurant, and there's not enough rum in the skies to put a stop to a tantrum like that.
codex.5b22e70bd2b99a0c4ea346a09c6a164d=Ridiculous blonde haircut, facial scars, far too much perfume, tanned skin: Violet. Violet is probably the most pompous of the marauders. She speaks with a ridiculously fake and hauty saborian accent (or what she thinks is a saborian accent) and has a habit of doing everything with a level of theatrics that would make an amateur stage play look like a magnum opus. Her crew will attempt to strip you and yours of all your valuables as well as everything that isn't nailed down. Mercifully, they are notoriously bad at working together and will often squabble over who gets what spoils before they've even left. More than once people have been able to sneak away unharmed as two of her crew have started a \"gentlemans duel\" over some trinket and been too self absorbed to notice. 
codex.e6f09f0f74352f5779012e9c6080cb5c=Face mask, goggles, spiky helm, unbelievably tall: Maggot, or one of his crew. My only advice: run. Run very far away and don't attempt to fight him. Maggot has the most suicidally devoted and blood thirsty crew of any of the marauder gangs, and isn't exactly well known for leaving survivors to tell tales. Larsi is the only survivor anyone's ever heard of and he doesn't even have a tongue anymore to tell us how he managed to get away (and he never, ever stopped talking). You can't bribe the bastard, you can't kill him - the best you can do is avoid him and hope. 
codex.f5097e36ca87b143a195bef7e7f93b29=Day 3 of the Hunt\r\n\r\nIt has been a vicious hunt so far. The second day of the hunt taught us the harsh lesson that most of these manta droppings cannot be taken alive. We've managed to eradicate a few of the lesser crews, but it is a heavy burden to bear the weight of this bloodshed. Some of them have surrendered and been brought to justice, but I feel as we get closer and closer to that cold tyrant Maggot the less likely it is that any of them will. \r\n\r\nIf nothing else, this will keep my sweet Lily safe at home.
codex.bbbaea56c0bb5cbba8e78fd91be4b79e=Day 12 of the Hunt\r\n\r\nWe picked up two stragglers today, hiding in an abandoned inn in sector 6. One of them, Bucket, has the mark of those accursed scum but came quietly enough and I believe him when he swears he has defected. His companion is heavily injured, and Bucket says that he survived a run in with Maggot himself. Given the scars on what I am sure was a once handsome face I do not doubt it for a moment. \r\n\r\nWe left them in the hold of the command ship. We don't believe they are dangerous but we cannot be too careful. If nothing else, they will assist in the hunt ahead. 
codex.5a4b6e29e5b6acdf2ade6bafe4198855=Day 31 of the Hunt\r\n\r\nI got careless today. We boarded the ship of Clot, a wretched drunkard. The stench was unbearable... We were storming his quarters where the coward had left his men to hide, and one of his men got the drop on us. His knife was in my back before we could put the beast down. The medic says I'll live, but the wound has been infected by the filth that his knife was stained with. I'll be out of action for a few days. Clot was able to escape in the commotion as well.\r\n\r\nI miss my daughter. \r\n\r\nDay 37 of the Hunt\r\n\r\nI started spending time with Bucket's friend while I'm in recovery. He's a gentle sort, and I was shocked to discover he was once a marauder too. Though he cannot speak, nor even see me, he has taught himself to write while blind, and thus we have had many a conversation between my voice and a few stray scraps of paper. His handwriting is appalling, but his words are passionate and charming. I question why someone of his intelligence would choose to spend his time with an... interesting man like Bucket, but it is not my business. \r\n\r\nThe medic says the infection is clearing and I should be cleared to return to battle soon. 
codex.253a8c46684dccd4461de141f8a712ce=Day 142 of the Hunt\r\n\r\nLily's safe haven was attacked by those monsters, seeking to punish me. She survived. Thank the ancestors she survived. I've had her moved to somewhere safer, along with Bucket's companion. He's too frail to be out here fighting with us.\r\n\r\nI dread to think the man I would have become if I had lost her. I have spilled enough blood already.
codex.821d5ac419133f7729e5658b7c1cb190=Day 260 of the Hunt\n\nThe lesser vermin have all been cleaned. Only Violet and Maggot remain. Clot has vanished, and so has his crew. We can worry about them later. \n\nWe're so close. 
codex.e0774956e99bf5f5831267db4804600b=Day 321 of the Hunt\r\n\r\nWe finally captured the infamous Violet. At first I could not understand the collective obsession with her, but when I caught sight of her beautiful eyes and that devilish grin I almost lost myself. It wouldn't have mattered in the end though, as when we put her on trial she jumped upon her chair, gesturing wildly, and bid us all farewell before swallowing a poison capsule she had hidden under her tongue. I threw her worthless corpse overboard myself. A fitting end to such human filth.\r\n\r\n(The paper is tattered, the handwriting shaky. This entry was written in a hurry).\r\nDay 322 of the Hunt\r\n\r\nShe had us all fooled. Violet had faked her death and led Maggot right to us! We prepare now for our final battle. Everything has been leading to this moment - we cannot fail! \r\n\r\nEven now we watch their ships loom on the horizon. Every bone in my body is screaming at me to run, but I think of my daughter, of the world I want to make for her, and it gives me courage. \r\n\r\nWe expect them to launch their attack at nightfall. This will be my final entry.
codex.a41f5fc7580b43396ab8d57c9a43dfeb=We found part of the remains of one of Maggots crew ships today. A cargo ship by the look of it, solid titanium hull. The wings were blown to dust, the engines were burnt out and theres some kind of seepage all over the exposed parts of the deck. It's almost completely buried into the island, so it'll take a while to dig the rest out. I'm not sure what Clarie is thinking, but it's not my place to question her. The entrance to the ships hull is completely blocked, so we began to dig it out.\r\n\r\nFrom a glance, it seems like they blew up part of the mountain to bury the ship, after they trashed the wings and engines. The ships mast is mostly destroyed as well. There's a good chance the core is still intact though, so we might be able to salvage some parts from that at least. Why in the blue blazes he'd waste a perfectly grand ship like this though, is beyond my reckoning. \r\n\r\nHe's always been a funny one, that Maggot. I joined the Marauders because I used to admire him, but since I've joined, I've started to question what's going on behind that mask.
codex.755ca863fbd8fa47d1117066466de275=Second day of our excavation. Jay got some of that weird liquid on him while trying to blast our way into the hold and it damn near melted his uniform. The stench is awful, too. We managed to get the main door to the hold open - it had been welded shut. I almost wish we hadn't though, as the wave of just... filth and rot that met our nostrils was enough for us to empty our stomachs onto the deck. \r\n\r\nWe tied ourselves into pairs and grabbed some lanterns. I went with Claire, Jay and Songbird stayed in the upper levels of the ship, and we left Murlo and Ram on the deck as lookout. A few of the other lads stayed on our own ship too, just in case. Claire was insistent we head to the deepest part of the decks right away. I obliged. I definitely wish I hadn't. \r\n\r\nIt was like something out of Violets ghoulish plays. Filth and muck coated the walls, made it hard to keep footing. The smell almost burned the inside of our noses, and it was hard to breath from all the spores in the air. There were bones amongst the muck and slime, and inside most of the crews rooms the doors and walls were covered in claw marks and mad scratchings. This ship had been airborne just 3... no, maybe 4 days, before it was in the state we found it. Did Maggots crew live like this? We had to leave before finding anything, as it was too hard to breathe
codex.a5d6cf1762c0aae80941cb09243a0fe2=Clarie and the others were too upset to go back in to check the rest of the ship, so I tied myself to the remains of the ship's mast and went back in alone. I brought my face mask and a pistol. Just in case. On the third layer of the ship was the ships engines and storage. I was right, the core was still in perfect order. I pulled some of the wiring and computer parts out and put them into my satchel, for safe keeping. I assumed there was nothing else of worth left amongst the trash, but just as I was leaving I noticed a door behind the atlas core. I shone my light on it clearer, and painted on the wall and door was a chilling message: \"TRAITORS GET WHAT TRAITORS GIVE\". \r\n\r\nI leaned in closer, putting my ear to the door, and I heard groaning. Someone was alive in there! The door was welded shut just like the door on the deck above, so I ran back up and got some help. We burned the door open as fast as we could, and inside it were 3 people. They were absolutely emaciated, and covered in their own filth. These weren't prisoners, these were Maggots own crew, bearing our mark on their chests like every other marauder in his crew. Tattoo'd over their heart, to show their devotion.\r\n\r\nThe ship and its contents painted a chilling picture indeed. One of those poor souls died a few hours later, too sickly to have survived the ordeal. The other two explained that they had failed during an important raid, and Maggot had ordered them to be trapped in the ship and the ship to be buried, to forever rid himself of the failure. If we hadn't found them, that ship would have been their rancid tomb, and yet they still begged us to bring them back to him, certain he'd forgive them.\r\n\r\nMadness.
codex.2f9bfc3216211088f07909e7ffb35684=Everyone knows the deal with the three main bosses and their gangs, but Marauders are a diverse bunch. I've compiled a list of some of the more notable gangs so you can identify them, although given the rate that Marauder gangs are formed, disbanded, and combined, there's a good chance that this list is already out of date.
codex.3c160a2d0698326877f65f98e5618518=Cinderhead's Strong Boys:\r\n\r\nI'm sure Cinderhead would like to be considered one of the main bosses, and he's certainly formidable in a fight, but he's not capable of organizing anything, including his own gang. \r\n\r\nThe Strong Boys are monsters. They prefer to get up close when in a fight, and will often win fights by flinging opponents from their ships rather than firing a shot. The best strategy with these guys is to keep your distance, none of them can fire a cannon particularly accurately, but if they do manage to board your vessel it might be safer to just abandon ship.
codex.fbacf4c6b23e333ec8286f0e4f204c43=The Shark Gang:\r\n\r\nThese guys are easy to identify. They all wear the same mask, crudely painted to look like a.. A shark I guess?\r\n\r\nIt's true that the Shark Gang are more interested in mischief than plunder, but that doesn't mean that they aren't dangerous. Most of their \"pranks\" involve putting bombs in unexpected places, or replacing important medicine with chilli powder.\r\n\r\nIf you get one cornered they can be surprisingly handy with a pistol and they're quick enough to be hard to hit. The best thing to do is to try not to react to their pranks. Hopefully they'll get bored and move on.
codex.a65b886ea964564619ef11dc5778b37f=Bloodclaw:\r\n\r\nBloodclaw were becoming a real force to be reckoned with, at one point they had almost enough ships to challenge Clot's gang, but they haven't been seen in some time. \r\n\r\nThey were known for being strong but fair. If challenged they'd put up a hell of a fight, but they wouldn't be cruel for the sake of cruel. If you meet these guys just give them what they want and they'll leave you alone.
codex.8da31decdf77421c5514f365ac0589db=Maggie's gang\r\n\r\nMaggie and Violet were inseparable as children, so it's unsurprising that Maggie's gang is still around. Considering Maggie only has about 6 ships under her it's probably safe to say that her connection with Violet is providing her some level of protection. Those 6 ships, however, are crewed by competent folks. Make no mistake, Maggie is a Marauder through and through.\r\n\r\nMaggie's captains are all women, and they're all violent and sadistic. They're great pilots, so your best bet is to try to get in close or to outrun them.
codex.d817cac6745f62e57b73af6d70d9c3b5=Rajas\r\n\r\nSpending most of their time in the Badlands, Rajas have become adept at guerilla warfare. They tend to avoid open conflict, resorting more to hit and run attacks, laying traps and stowing away on unsuspecting ships.\r\n\r\nThey fly a flag with a Manta on it, and rarely speak. Not much more is known about this gang.
codex.f13ff657207088a29da95d495eaf65fe=Scabs\r\n\r\nA Scab is a Marauder who doesn't fight under a particular boss or gang. These guys vary greatly in strength and ethos. Sometimes a Scab crew will pair up with a gang on individual jobs, but generally they just fly around doing whatever they want.
codex.9b6d693191b61c0329df3277493d1b1f=I knew I'd have to look after my brother, Barrin, my whole life. He's the smartest guy I know but he hasn't got an ounce of common sense. He always had his head buried in some machine or other. I remember one time when we were kids he was taking apart a gauntlet or something. He was concentrating on it so hard he didn't even notice the Mantas bearing down on our ship. I never saw our father move so quick! He punched a manta square in the face (or whatever passes for a face on a Manta). So cool. Broke his arm in 3 places.\n\nEven after all that my brother said nothing. He just got up and went inside where it was quiet. \n\nWhat he could do with a machine, though, that was amazing. He made his own grapple booster at the age of about 13. The thing would catapult you six or seven times further than the standard one, but when you've got the grace of a wingless Thuntomite like Barrin that power doesn't come in handy very often. 
codex.0c9b2acb2a6029671de60d17c5630c17=Another time our Atlas Core malfunctioned out in open sky. We thought we were done for! Something went wrong with the \"control unit\" according to Barrin. We were sinking pretty gradually but we weren't going to make it to an island in time. That's when he turned to me and looked me straight in the eye.\r\n\r\n\"Can you shoot down some of them Thuntomites?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"We don't have time for hunting right now, Barrin, we've got bigger things to worry about!\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't say anything back. He just gave me this look that made me feel like a right dummy. \r\n\r\nAs we got a bit closer to an island I was able to get within range of some Thuntomites and shoot them down. Once we'd wrangled three of the corpses onto the ship he strung them together using these string like things from inside their bodies and he hooked them into the core. You can imagine my surprise when the thing started working again!\r\n\r\nAfter we made it to the safety of an island I asked him how the fix worked. He spent about an hour trying to explain but I never did understand a word that boy said.
codex.f9a120f1512161ef1629656ee75a38f2=After dad got killed by a group of these so called \"Marauders\" things changed a lot for us. Alone and with no ship, Barrin and I had to learn to fend for ourselves by any means necessary. Well, I had to learn to fend for the both of us. He didn't have the stomach for it. If anything he withdrew to his tinkering even more. When I killed my first man for the clothes on his back and the food in his pockets, he was working on some project. I must admit that his \"projects\" got more impressive day by day though. \r\n\r\nHe made a gunk that hardens like rock in seconds. We used it to fill the gaps in the rickety old ship I stole from some punk who tried to rob us at gunpoint.\r\n\r\nHe made an attachment for the ship helm that allows me to remotely shock anyone that touches it. That came in handy when we got boarded in the middle of the night and a guy tried to steal the ship. I've never seen a guy fly back so far!\r\n\r\nHe made a modified scanner that printed what the person you're scanning had for breakfast. Never could find a practical use for that one.
codex.c4a652bf01734bc9c7b1c86b768188fe=It was around this time where a small time Marauder gang boss called Shank came along. He and his boys planned to strip our ship for parts and leave us for dead, but we had other ideas. We retreated to our panic room, which I suppose lulled them into a false sense of security because they fell into almost all of our traps.\r\n\r\nThree of them died in the first toaster room. Four in the oil bar. When they tried to escape they got trapped in the soil tank. I couldn't resist going in to gloat. When Iooked at Shank's face poking out from the thick wall of soil I saw something that surprised met. I was expecting the fear, but I wasn't expecting the respect. He knew that I'd bested him and his men. He looked me in the eye and spoke to me:
codex.760086c30188b8a40d6ad22517de2651=\"These traps, boy, I've never seen anything like them! How did you make these?\"\r\n\r\nI was silent. He looked nervous.\r\n\r\n\"Erm... I can see you've got a sweet setup here, but have you ever considered joining up with a Marauder crew?\"\r\n\r\nI scoffed.\r\n\r\n\"No, really. You fly our colours and no-one will give you any trouble. Your gang have your back.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what if I kill you and take your ship? Won't that have the same effect?\" I replied.\r\n\r\nHe spluttered, clearly struggling with what to say to save his skin.\r\n\r\n\"Erm... Well, if you leave me and my boys alive we'll have your back. We can help you take whatever you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me I don't need you guys to take whatever I want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems you might be right. But I've been a Marauder for years, I have great intel.\"\r\n\r\nI dismissed this at first, but then I had a thought.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" I said \"Might you be able to help me track down the Marauders who killed my father?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes lit up, I guess because he'd seen an opportunity to negotiate for his life.
codex.db55789c5bbc2caa1dfed6ea03df119c=He agreed to help us to find the crew that killed our father, and we took our place at the head of Shank's gang. It was a warmer reception than we expected after the circumstances that led to us joining. The boys gave us a surprising level of respect.\r\n\r\nBeing a Marauder was a sweet gig, even if we were just a pack of Scabs. You wear those Marauder colours and people know you mean business. You don't actually need to do that much fighting if people expect you to be a monster. We'd usually just roll up on some trader ship, they'd throw up their hands and offer us whatever they were carrying. Easy.\r\n\r\nThey helped me look after Barrin too. They gave him any bits of old tech they found on our travels and provided him with loads of Thuntomite carcasses. He'd gotten really obsessed with trying to make something using them. They start to smell after a bit, but I could tell he was onto something big when I saw a carcass covered in wires and metal bits floating in his room one night. Well, sort of floating. Suspended in the air I guess. Weird.
codex.aaabf2d38e8ef677e01e043e0ae2aa2c=Shank was actually a nice guy. Rarely did any shanking as far as I could tell. He'd been asking around about the gang that killed our father, he'd narrowed it down to two possible guys. Either it was another Scab called Oik or this nightmare of a guy called Cinderhead. Oik's gang consisted of about 6 people with a reputation for itchy trigger fingers. Cinderhead's gang go by the name The Strong Boys, which sounds ridiculous, but they are some of the most dangerous guys in the skies.\r\n\r\nI asked Shank if he reckoned our crew could take down Cinderhead and he snorted his drink out of his nose.\r\n\r\nI took that as a no.
codex.29c7d97b59636069e84c6afa964f41b4=Over time my feelings on this crew softened. There's something that we'd been missing since our father died that we somehow found with this group of physically impressive imbeciles. I let myself be comfortable with them. \r\n\r\nA lot of other gangs were significantly more brutal and excessive than our boys. Our ethos was to only kill when you need to. If someone disrespects you, you break a finger, not a neck. If someone tries to cut you, however, all bets are off. People soon learn to give you what you want if they know you're going to leave afterwards.\r\n\r\nI pushed our crew to take on bigger and better targets. We went from a little known group of Scabs to a well respected crew in a few short months. 
codex.4d42a9fd6235088cfd89b8c9de987d66=In the meantime, Barrin was finishing up his latest invention. Basically it's a backpack that... Sort of... It sort of \"pauses\" motion? I guess? Something about atlas polarity? Whatever it is, it looks scary as all hell. I don't know if he did it in purpose to make the things more intimidating but they kind of look like a skull... or a demon. It's made of a bunch of different things, but there's definitely some pieces of Thuntomite in it. I guess that explained all the shells he'd been messing with.\r\n\r\nWe took the prototype to Shank to see what he thought of it and you should have seen the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"This... This is amazing! This is exactly the kind of thing we need to give us an edge! Come look at this boys.\"\r\n\r\nThe other guys in the gang crowded round to look at the pack.\r\n\r\n\"I call it the Stasis Immobilizer\" Barrin said.\r\n\r\n\"That sounds ridiculous. Let's call it something cool. How about the Immobilator?\" suggested Shank.\r\n\r\nIt was the stupidest name I'd ever heard but the others all grunted in agreement. I suppose that's what it's called now then. Barrin was cringing.\r\n\r\n\"What does it do?\" asked Beans.\r\n\r\n\"It... Well... I'm not sure, but it looks amazing. What does it do Barrin?\"
codex.253d90bfb16762799374a2a6933c3ee3=It's incredible, the breadth of things you can do when you can hold yourself in place for a few seconds. I could go into the specifics about the new strategies we started using when raiding ships, but the long and short of it is we became completely unpredictable. Our opponents had no idea how to deal with us.\r\n\r\nThe downside of having a new toy that no one else has is it puts a target on your back. We had other crews coming after us every other day. The upside was that we didn't have to do any more work on figuring out who killed Barrin and I's father. When Oik came for the Immobilators I knew immediately. I heard his voice when he made his demands to us and it all came flooding back. 
codex.f15420fdb95605e56eb75bc11fae5bd2=After my initial realisation I was furious. Then I was relieved. I wasn't going to have to try to kill Cinderhead. Oik certainly looked like he could handle himself, but I doubted that he could snap my neck with his bare hands. \r\n\r\nI turned to Beans and gave him the signal. Moments later we were catapulting across Oik's ship. Using the Immobilators meant that Oik and his men couldn't get a lock on us. We'd killed half of them before they'd even drawn their weapons. They started shooting but that isn't enough when you don't know where your target is going to be.\r\n\r\nOne or two of Oik's crew tried to board our ship to distract us, but they quickly fell into Barrin's traps. I trusted the men to take care of the rest of them, but Oik was mine. I knocked him down with a knee to the head and kicked his gun away. He looked up at me with contempt, but also acceptance. He knew he'd been bested. I ended it quickly.\r\n\r\nIt felt great to have avenged our father, but our luck couldn't last forever. The more crews we took down the more gangs came looking for us. We just didn't have the manpower.
codex.3ab88fa41bc552e6c878f8b0a7109082=Shank had an idea, though. He sent word to a selection of minor gang members he knew that he was willing to trade them their very own Immobilators. One by one they turned up tentatively to negotiate. Initially they were worried that we were setting traps for people and using the Immobilators as bait, but once the first through transactions went through without a hitch word got around and it was easy to offload packs (although we made sure to keep enough for ourselves too).\r\n\r\nSoon most of the smaller Scab gangs had an Immobilator between them. Those guys hadn't had the time to figure out how to make use of the packs, so by the time the bigger gangs came for them they were easy targets. Easier targets than us by far. That meant the attacks started coming less and less. Why try to take down our crew when you could go after other small fry?
codex.9c6587c49ba79c10b7210c91b35064b8=With all the weapons and loot we'd built up from looting the Marauders who came to kill us we a good chunk of gear and resources worth trading, so we were able to slip away undetected. We broke up our ship and used the components to build a few lower profile vessels and retreated to some quiet corners of the skies. From there we were each able to live in relative peace and safety.\r\n\r\nI often look back at the terrible things I did to get us to where we are now, but I have to believe that they were worth it. We live comfortably with more than enough to live on and Barrin is safe. I think Shank still sometimes yearns to go pillaging on the open skies, but for now at least we have everything we need, and if anyone does try to take from us they'll regret it.
